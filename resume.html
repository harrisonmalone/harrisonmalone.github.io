      <div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #eaecef;"><h2>Volunteer Work</h2></div>
      <h3>Writer</h3>
      <p>I consistently write technology focused blog posts for my <a href="http://harrisonmalone.github.io/blog" target="_blank">own website</a> and for small publications. I enjoy thinking about how technology is shaping my life; from product recommendations to app addictions I have. I recently contributed for <a href="https://reckoner.com.au/2018/01/apples-homepod-the-resurgence-of-audio-entertainment/" target="_blank">The Reckoner</a> which is a website that writes about the culture of technology and modern life in Australia.</p>
      <h3>Podcasting</h3>
      <p>I curate a <a href="http://harrisonmalone.github.io/podcast">sports podcast called The Melon</a>. I've always been fascinated by sports broadcasting (I used to commentate myself playing in the backyard) and that continues today through this little project where we discuss issues from our favourite sports competitions.</p>
      <p>Further to this, I worked as a social media manager for the <a href="https://insiderunningpodcast.podbean.com/" target="_blank">Inside Running Podcast</a> which is a weekly distance running news show. I maintained their podcast Instagram page where I posted snippets from the latest episodes as well as trying to engage with new people who might be interested in listening.</p>
      <h3>Sports Coach and Umpire</h3>
      <p>I work weekends as a football field umpire. I enjoy the challenges umpiring throws up and the interactions I have with people from all walks of life in the local community. I've also coached cricket and cross country to kids with varying experience levels.</p>

      <h3>The University of Melbourne | Bachelor of Arts | 2012-2015</h3>
