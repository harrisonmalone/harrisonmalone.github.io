## Legacy Personal Website

This is a project started mid way through my first cohort working at CoderAcademy. It's a diary of sorts; mostly documenting the things we're covering in class but includes some other more general diary writing as well ✨.

The website includes the aforementioned, a blog and a documentation page. The docs page is perhaps the most interesting part of the website (as its just been added). It includes things that I've seen or learnt throughout my life and ranks them.
