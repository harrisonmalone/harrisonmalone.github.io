        <p>work on code for a few hours</p>
        <p>organise all clothes and camping stuff, maybe go and buy a chair</p>
        <p>could also go op shopping and search for an outfit for everyone</p>
        <p>get jakes help with groceries, alcohol and car</p>
        <p>go to kevs, get kev to pack everything in</p>

        <p>got through some <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2037401281">k&#8217;s</a> this morning</p>
        <p>going to bbq, really need to watch that lecture this evening and do some work</p>
        <p>when i get back from falls head to vodafone, i think i&#8217;m entitled now to a much better deal</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/plans/sim-only">lots more data</a> which makes a big difference for me in terms of consumption of apple music</p>

        <p>boxing day tomorrow, early wake up</p>
        <p>need to work on some code 27th and 28th</p>

        <p>i can see why it has that cult classic status</p>
        <p>some thoughts on this keyboard, you do need to hit the keys a bit harder than usual to actually get the things to trigger</p>
        <p>its similar to the mac, it takes a solid press down to get the right text input, you&#8217;ll get used to the keyboard but you&#8217;ll make some mistakes initially, the other thing too is that the keys are a slightly different shape, it&#8217;s like typing on a pc </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2030626061#kudos">run</a> today felt solid</p>
        <p>tomorrow wouldn&#8217;t mind writing a post about how i&#8217;m using <a href="https://blogtrottr.com">blogtrotter</a> or even more generally how i&#8217;m organising my reading material</p>
        <p>this includes things like pinboard and my email subscriptions etc</p>
        <p>maybe other things that i&#8217;d like to include in my reading</p>
        <p>also how i&#8217;m keeping with certain things through podcasts </p>

        <p>reverted back to basic fonts, played around with some hover effects but nothing really suited what i wanted</p>
        <p>keys to this websites style, don't worry about the displaying reading text, it's only problematic in safari on ipad and mac, iphone safari doesn't cause issues</p>
        <p>important to get links going, it adds colour to an otherwise blank page</p>
        <p>need to share more photos taken in recent times, for example this photo of <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jlc008hrpfvjz25/dad_and_jake.jpg?dl=0">jake and my dad</a></p>
        <p>also try and get some more writing done over the break</p>
        <p>10am - 6pm is bad to call europe, other hours are when mum will be up</p>

        <p>built a basic full stack MERN app</p>
        <p>class finished early for christmas break</p>
        <p>remember to post the video of the code along up</p>
        <h2 id="dec-20"><a class="header-link" href="#dec-20">DEC 20</a></h2>
        <p>middleware is just a function that runs before the (req, res) =&gt; callback occurs</p>
        <p>hence the middleware name</p>
        <p>we did an example where we found a user and then checked if the username and password were correct based on a post request that was sent from the client</p>
        <p>we added to the request object so that it had a req.user key and a user as it's attribute which we then accessed in the app.post where we passed in the middleware</p>
        <p>the status on the response is always set to 200, we can override it with the res.status() function</p>
        <p>discovered that you can debug express in the same way as i have been with other javascript files using node inspect and setting breakpoints</p>
        <p>just need to do the initial c to get the server running at port 5000</p>
        <h2 id="dec-19"><a class="header-link" href="#dec-19">DEC 19</a></h2>
        <p>learning about forms in react</p>
        <p>onChange event listeners on each of the inputs</p>
        <p>special [] syntax on the setState key</p>
        <p>there's a handleClick on the form submit, within this method there's an axios post call</p>
        <p>having the submitForm method in the parent makes it reusable, we can use it on other child components if need be</p>
        <p>installed axios and now implementing the end point correctly</p>
        <p>solution to problems i was having with getting data back from pinboard, when you get a cors error it's browser related, if you can't get the data from cors you can usually get it on the backend, like in express, and then once you have it in express you can send it to the front end (react is excellent at dealing with this data through state)</p>
        <p>i also had to pass an auth object in axios which i found the answer for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44072750/how-to-send-basic-auth-with-axios">here</a></p>
        <p>finished off the put part of the form app, pretty similar to post in terms of calling the same axios method in react, and then accessing the req.body</p>
        <p>however the tricky part was working out what to pass in as params</p>
        <p>in this case params were a username, so you kind of had to know the username, but in a full stack web app you'd surely have easy access to the current user or whatever you needed to edit</p>
        <p>this whole project is a great example of the power of passing parent methods down as props, used the same submitForm method to access the user that was generated from state in the form child</p> 
        <p>to insert data into express (from api) need to firstly run the localhost:5000/data end point, would probably have database setup to remove this</p> 
        <h2 id="dec-18"><a class="header-link" href="#dec-18">DEC 18</a></h2>
        <p>new way of doing fetch</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">axios</a></p>
        <p>cors blocking the response, this is due to the browser, can use that browser extension but it's really insecure</p>
        <p>it's already a lot cleaner because you can use the simple .get or .post</p>
        <p>you need to pass so much more information to make a post request happen with fetch</p>
        <p>axios halves how much code you have to write</p>
        <p>the power of axios instances is that we can create a default baseurl and not have to use the same thing over and over again</p>
        <p>we can also set a username and password in the headers</p>
        <p>npx downloads the executable from the actual source, one reason why you'd want to use npx is to connect to the latest version of create-react-app, also if you were using someone elses computer and didn't want to download all the CLI tools as it would just be bloat for them</p>
        <p>tried to get pinboard api working so i could play around with data in react, failed but managed to do it on the 19th</p>

        <p>helped out with java bootcamp</p>
        <p>ran through the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/1b8cca83bc8ecf705cfee15367d27094">css grid solution</a> and did some simple content for javascript events</p>
        <p>afternoon was spent working on some java</p>
        <p>tonight do some more of the freecodecamp react stuff, also should try to finish the bike challenge</p>
        <p>this morning was thinking about giving them a google maps challenge with position absolute and some cards, didn't have my own version working because of an api key, fixed that up this afternoon, code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/c220d28341758c8514fc75fcc6677415">here</a></p>
        <p>use GA in vim to get to last line of file and also start up edit mode</p>
        <p>use d to remove a line</p>
        <p>command d splits your terminal in half</p>
        <p>shift command d un-splits the separate terminal windows</p>

        <p>dog walk</p>
        <p>work on challenge and java content</p>
        <p>both runs this weekend weren't great, i think i'm pretty worn down for various reasons, need to just head out slow when i'm running big miles</p>
        <p>i think it also helps going out early for the run, getting it done, planning this a few days out helps</p>
        <p>working on code was pretty dry this weekend too, just need to dedicate a few hours to get stuff done</p>
        <h2 id="dec-15"><a class="header-link" href="#dec-15">DEC 15</a></h2>
        <p>cleaned, picked up stuff</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2017530484">ran</a> but felt like crap, had a chill night</p>
        <p>watched <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Holland%27s_Opus">mr hollands opus</a> which was one of the most moving movies i've seen in ages</p>
        <p>if i ever need inspiration for why i teach the message from this movie is why</p>

        <p>Jon's lecture on <a href="https://youtu.be/VoeeHfDDU_8">lifecycle methods</a> in react</p>
        <p>thinking about life cycle methods</p>
        <p>how it's going to mount elements to the DOM, how it's going to update your component, changes the display and the destruction of the component</p>
        <p>render() is a lifecycle method, we can return null in render if we like, render is drawing to the screen</p>
        <p>componentDidMount() is triggered after the constructor, triggered once, triggered when the element actually exists on the page</p>
        <p>componentDidUpdate() is triggered when react detects that something has changed, iterates over all child elements, detects changes that happen through props</p>
        <p>componentWillUnmount() happens immediately before the component is destroyed</p>
        <p>these methods happen automatically anyway, we implement our own custom logic, it's like initialize in a ruby class</p>
        <p>setState() triggers a re-render</p>
        <p>code for <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/e5e0fafeb7a204d46806b58326f0316a">generating a random user card</a> which is a great example of when we need to use life cycle methods to perform actions at a certain point in the components life cycle</p>

        <p>Jon's lecture on <a href="https://youtu.be/lvU2euoQkfc">state</a> in react</p>
        <p>state challenge was making a total count for each click (adding an animal to the to zoo list)</p>
        <p>using state and setState to change state when a certain method is triggered</p>
        <p>worked on this challenge for most of the afternoon</p>
        <p>we can't do this.state = {} anywhere but in the constructor</p>
        <p>in our instance methods to assign state we need to use setState({})</p>
        <p>you need to bind the context of this to access this instance of something</p>
        <p>code for the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/940a7ea9d5af595533932c7284ac2abf">to zoo list challenge</a> which is a great example for state in react</p>
        <h2 id="dec-12"><a class="header-link" href="#dec-12">DEC 12</a></h2>
        <p>morning was spent reviewing what we had done on Monday for React and helping students with their projects, watched Jon's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnqEiADeDIQ&feature=youtu.be">lecture</a></p>
        <p>have notes from more of Jon's lecture <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/9e457d1f78b86ca0c90f306504b3a96b">here</a></p>
        <p>passing props to stateless functional components</p>
        <p>wondering what state is, covered tomorrow</p>
        <p>a stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX</p>
        <p>a stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state</p>
        <p>finally, a stateful component is any component that does maintain its own internal state, you may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components</p>
        <p>the react docs tutorial isn't that great for a beginner</p>
        <p>freecodecamp much easier to understand, where i'm <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/review-using-props-with-stateless-functional-components">up to</a></p>
        <p>this was also helpful in wrapping my head around <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-fundamentals/looping-in-jsx">looping through components</a> by passing in different props</p>
        <p>helped out with java again in the afternoon</p>

        <p>difference between get and post for a '/login' form route</p>
        <p>jquery's killer feature was querySelector ${'#myId'}</p>
        <p>now this is pretty obsolete</p>
        <p>we then looked at promises again</p>
        <p>returning another fetch within a .then means the next .then takes the new response as the parameter</p>

        <p>REST</p>
        <p>read <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest">this</a> at some point, it's about REST</p>

        <p>recap from yesterday</p>
        <p>what is node, what is express</p>
        <p>middleware, gives us access to the request body, and converts it to a json object</p>
        <p>object destructuring, accessing the final key in an object by using it's name in the variable declaration</p>
        <p>const { name } = req.body</p>
        <p>npm start is special, you can leave off the word run</p>
        <p>install mongoose</p>
        <p>mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/nameofdb')</p>
        <p>showing if mongoose has connected with .on</p>
        <p>separate folder for our models</p>
        <p>the we have files with our model names</p>
        <p>defining a schema</p>
        <p>pokemonSchema = new.mongoose.Schema({})</p>
        <p>mongoose.model('Pokemon', pokemonSchema)</p>
        <p>export it out</p>
        <p>require it back into the main file</p>
        <p>by connecting the model pokemon to the pokedex database we automatically create plural (pokemons) collection</p>
        <p>after lunch students either did a mongoose challenge or the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/ce59a6132000d4f26d0c1fd92109fdc7">object destructuring challenge</a> i wrote</p>
        <p>then we had drinks to finish off term</p>

        <p>document databases are great in cases where you need some persistence quickly</p>
        <p>but in cases where your database is enormous then a relational database might be a better option</p>
        <p>mongo is written to emulate the structure of json</p>
        <p>today we're replacing the array task part of yesterday with a real database, to get some persistence happening</p>
        <p>the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-modern-application-stack-part-1-introducing-the-mean-stack">MERN stack</a></p>
        <p>db use pokedex</p>
        <p>this creates the db</p>
        <p>db.createCollection('pokemon')</p>
        <p>this creates the collection</p>
        <p>using _id</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.insert({_id: 1, name: 'something'})</p>
        <p>this inserts a pokemon document into the collection</p>
        <p>so we created a collection and filled it with some documents</p>
        <p>how this compares to relational databases: collection is a table, documents are rows</p>
        <p>when you say use databaseName then db is the shortcut to that database</p>
        <p>you can pass it multiple objects by passing in an array</p>
        <p>using .toArray on a cursor, a cursor is returned if you use .find so we need to convert it to an array to interact with it nicely</p>
        <p>findOne just returns the object, not the cursor</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.update({name: 'something'}, {name: 'bulb'})</p>
        <p>it deletes additional fields</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.update({name: 'bulb'}, {$set: {name: 'bulbiii'}})</p>
        <p>this retains the original fields in your record</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.updateMany({}, {$set: {admin: false}})</p>
        <p>updates everything and sets it's admin to false</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.find({})</p>
        <p>finds all</p>
        <p>db.pokemon.remove({})</p>
        <p>removes all</p>
        <p>mongo is case specific unless you set a certain flag</p>
        <p>finding pokemon in this file</p>
        <p>setting a relationship between two different tables</p>
        <p>using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19441228/insert-json-file-into-mongodb">mongoimport</a></p>
        <p>mongoimport --jsonArray --db test --collection docs --file example2.json</p>

        <p>redid what we did in the previous day but extended it with todolist challenge</p>
        <p>this involved finding a nice way to increment the ids and searching by ids</p>
        <p>i think we also did some more catch up on challenges in the morning</p>
        <h2 id="nov-27"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-27">NOV 27</a></h2>
        <p>morning was a general time to revise whatever you wanted</p>
        <p>went through some maths</p>
        <p>figured out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/f4ccf3eecafa1e42b8db6d785ffe3d06">morning challenge</a></p>
        <p>helped with creating an <a href="https://gist.github.com/9c1ad75ab400fe1a3d47ad2eebaf6541">array range function</a> that increments based on steps</p>
        <p>i think everyone went fine in the maths test, people seemed confident</p>
        <p>express and npm introduction</p>
        <p>created a package.json file that does similar things to a gemfile</p>
        <p>created an array of pokemon objects and used them in GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests</p>
        <p>added nodemon as a script to &quot;start&quot; so server automatically refreshes when changes are made</p>
        <p>the basics of express are just like routes in rails, mixed in with some controller logic</p>
        <p>also used <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/joi">Joi</a> for some simple validations on data we passed into PUT request, not really important apart from today's lesson</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/c69781edf1e9bfee0d232abd8b85b381">today's code</a> has some nice pseudocode that runs through what everything is doing</p>
        <h2 id="nov-26"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-26">NOV 26</a></h2>
        <p>went through the basics of fetch again</p>
        <p>excellent analogy from jon, fetch is like going to a restaurant and you order a steak, the waiter doesn't stop and go make your steak, the waiter keeps taking other orders and delegates the cooking of the steak to the chef, we don't know when the steak is going to be ready, the waiter continues on taking orders like usual</p>
        <p>the promise returned by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then">.then</a> gets resolved with a value you can use in a subsequent .then or as the endpoint (usually json)</p>
        <p>pulled data from the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">pokemon api</a></p>
        <p>started with a get request on the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/">entire list of pokemon</a></p>
        <p>filtered to have only the original 151</p>
        <p>made all pokemon on home page have links to their individual page using index</p>
        <p>using string interpolation and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location">window.location.search</a> to get ids</p>
        <p>window.location returns a url kind of object, search returns whatever is after the ? or the query string of the url</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr">substr</a> returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterward</p>
        <p>more complex appending stuff to the dom</p>
        <p>element.insertAdjacentHTML(position, text)</p>
        <p>as abilities and moves were an array we had to loop through them, insert the text into a li node and then append that li node to a ul parent</p>
        <p>played around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/3153c3afd5d6200fbb31f845ae061f22">factory functions</a></p>
        <p>completed <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/0b9cd5e249b230acda43993a59f734b7">pokedex code</a>, will keep working on it in coming days</p>
        <p>maths revision or extra javascript</p>
        <p>maths test tomorrow</p>
        <h2 id="nov-25"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-25">NOV 25</a></h2>        
        <p>finished the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/e4027b0a3d2fa879d14215461bcc9a36">math problems</a> and did a range of js challenges</p>
        <p>need to bang through the rest of the github js challenges</p>
        <p>runs were okay this week, ended up at 41k, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1981530131">yesterday</a> was decent and went further than i thought, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1983812276">today</a> was pretty hard but got through</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/b17d0a6fc883eb1d5a1e6c83c983210e">morning challenge</a> for tomorrow</p>
        <h2 id="nov-24"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-24">NOV 24</a></h2>
        <p>voted and fixed up music</p>
        <p>cleaned house</p>
        <p>watched <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Dogs_(film)">isle of dogs</a> which was one of the best movies ive seen in ages </p>
        <h2 id="nov-23"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-23">NOV 23</a></h2>
        <p>quick run through of PATCH and DELETE requests</p>
        <p>similar to what we did yesterday with POST</p>
        <p>what is Node.js</p>
        <p>run through of the history of <a href="https://webkit.org/">webkit</a> and how that led to node </p>
        <p>created a simple <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/">node server</a> and went through line by line what everything was doing</p>
        <p>made the server end point plain text, html and json </p>
        <p>then looked at different built in node packages</p>
        <p>deleting books code, using fetch, similar to POST but had a slight work around with passing the ids to a forEach, converting the nodeList to an array using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from">Array.from</a>   </p>
        <p>maths review </p>
        <p>dinner at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Poco+Loco+Cantina/@-37.8863628,145.057462,19z/data=!4m9!1m3!2m2!1smexican+restaurants!6e5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9d48d06776ff83b3!8m2!3d-37.8864929!4d145.0580826">mexican place</a> in carnegie was super nice</p>

        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/0a1dd42ecd606df4a4589c92c83dabc8">morning challenge</a> with the special number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)">6174</a></p>
        <p>lots of maths review</p>
        <p>finished off the challenge from yesterday</p>
        <p>POST request with the in built vscode extension</p>
        <p>went through some of the css choices</p>
        <p>then created a new authors model with first name and last name</p>
        <p>ran the seed file</p>
        <p>accessing authors from rails app</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">destructuring assignment</a></p>
        <p>created an html form to create books</p>
        <p>remember that names in all of the book inputs need to be the same as what you have in your rails model</p>
        <p>used fetch as a POST request</p>
        <p>had to pass in some options into fetch to make it not default to a GET</p>
        <p>remember that in body we have to use JSON.stringify to convert a javascript object to JSON</p>
        <p>then it was a very similar process in terms of the dealing with the request as what we have yesterday</p>
        <p>maths test, will look at this tonight</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1978281061">run</a> was smooth</p>
        <p>felt strong, maybe go for a quickie after work tomorrow</p>
        <h2 id="nov-21"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-21">NOV 21</a></h2>
        <p>a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">promise</a> returns something asynchronously</p>
        <p>usually a request to an api that responds with json</p>
        <p>using .fetch to get the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">first promise</a> then we use the .json() method to extract the JSON body content from the response</p>
        <p>then we use another .then to get our books array</p>
        <p>the challenge involved looping through the books and then appending them to the dom </p>
        <p>toFixed(2) gives you 2 decimal places on a price number (1230 needs to be 12.30)</p>
        <p>using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/prepend">.prepend</a> to insert an element into the start of a node</p>
        <p>li.prepend(strong)</p>
        <p>code from the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/d953617bc6d33577ba4252a94d3631a2">challenge</a></p>
        <p>more challenges, applying some css to the books, POST request using REST client</p>
        <p>will be looking more at post requests tomorrow</p>
        <p>recap with matt, going through the callbacks challenges</p>
        <p>can copy as markdown if need be with the vscode extension</p> 
        <p>i bet we'll be using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify">JSON.stringify()</a> method tomorrow</p>               
        <h2 id="nov-20"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-20">NOV 20</a></h2>
        <p>hoisting, function declarations are hoisted but not expressions</p>
        <p>function test() {}</p>
        <p>this is hoisted</p>
        <p>const test = function() {}</p>
        <p>this is not hoisted</p>
        <p>it's the same principle for variables, really nice explanation in <a href="http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/variable-and-function-hoisting.html">this article</a></p>
        <p>today was mainly just a code along</p>
        <p>looked at requests and responses, requesting data from a rails app (getting json) and the responding with the json we&#8217;re asking for that we access with js</p>
        <p>the <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html">rails guide</a> is an excellent resource for creating api app</p>
        <p>created a rails app</p>
        <p>rails new bookstore --api</p>
        <p>scaffolded a book model / controller with a few attributes</p>
        <p>seeded the database with create</p>
        <p>remember to add that special line of code in routes so that our errors are in json format</p>
        <p>after checking to make sure we had our book instances in rails c we created a html, css and js boilerplate for getting the json</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">used fetch</a> and passed in the url which in this case was localhost but can be any api url (like chuck norris jokes)</p>
        <p>at this point we got the cors error, had to update the cors rails file to whitelist the localhost we were running the js on</p>
        <p>got another promise</p>
        <p>used .then which took a callback to get the response</p>
        <p>we had to call the .json() method on this response to parse it</p>
        <p>returned the data (as another promise)</p>
        <p>did another .then which took a callback returned the array of books</p>
        <p>lunch and went to excursion</p>
        <p>excursion was at data center, pretty interesting stuff</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1974867958">run</a> probably pushed a little too hard but great to get through 9k</p>
        <p>was trying to solve morning challenge and found a solution that uses <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tribonacci-numbers/">recursion</a></p>
        <p>realized how bad i am at understanding recursion, read through <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/recursion.html">this</a> and tried to do some pseudocode, talk to matt about problem tomorrow</p>
        <h2 id="nov-19"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-19">NOV 19</a></h2>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/d007f0605695ebee74fbdbb5946d6db0">morning challenge, counting vowels</a></p>
        <p>classes and objects </p>
        <p>looked very briefly at <a href="http://javascript.info/closure">closure</a>, need to look more into that
        <p>pointing to a variable</p>
        <p>let x = null</p>
        <p>let y = 10</p>
        <p>x = y</p>
        <p>think of variables as pointers to objects, when you assign directly to a variable, you are not modifying any objects you're merely repointing your variable to a different object</p>
        <p><a href="http://javascript.info/class-patterns">factory and constructor functions</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">.bind</a></p>
        <p>now moving on to using <a href="http://javascript.info/class">Class</a> keyword</p>
        <p>it just has a nicer clearer syntax that&#39;s similar to ruby</p>
        <p>getters and setters is again just a sugar syntax </p>
        <p>you can just write them as functions</p>
        <p>then we did a quick challenge</p>
        <p>discrete math recap</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/1fcc6b2f9dabd873d668fa0b8643d7c5">decimal to hex count up chart</a></p>

        <p>gets you the scroll position</p>

        <p>woke up with a slightly sore back, will need to roll it</p>
        <p>stuff to do: do some of the js drills, attempt one of the le wagon event listener challenges, try to refactor some of ruegens code for the snake game, also take a look at the clock again</p>
        <p>to access the ` symbol on ios keyboard you need to go to the ' symbol and hold down, then slide your finger to the ` symbol when it comes up</p>
        <p>this has been my best week of running in a long long time</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1970776510">today</a> felt fine i think because we paced it correctly in the first 5</p>
        <p>that run that i did on friday particularly helps, to really make things perfect i could have a shower in the toilets afterwards</p>
        <p>just need to bring a sports towel and a change of undies</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">this</a> is the best explanation of a callback, since it's mdn pretty much just follow what it says, also has some nice asynchronous clarification</p>

        <p>what matt asked from me, get some of the eventListener challenges from le wagon, rewrite some of the intermediate ruby challenges as js ones, could also grab some of the challenges from the first day of le wagon js</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1966043958">run</a> was just a nice little tap with hamish, felt pretty decent</p>

        <p>morning challenges</p>
        <p>Object.values(obj)</p>
        <p>this returns the values of an object</p>
        <p>did a recap of js callbacks</p>
        <p>looked at various examples of .forEach, .map, .filter etc </p>
        <p>remember a callback is simply a function that we store as an argument and then invoke in the method</p>
        <p>then looked at browser javascript </p>
        <p>did a challenge altering github squares</p>
        <p>use things like querySelector and Math.random</p>
        <p>also used .forEach </p>
        <p>demoed the nice examples</p>
        <p>then we looked at putting javascript in html </p>
        <p>takeaway was that we need the DOM to be fully loaded in order for js to work correctly (do things in console like accessing a const)</p>
        <p>can put js under the body but best practice is to use defer and put javascript into a separate file </p>
        <p>had a review class for callbacks, lots of concerns from students</p>
        <p>did the <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/68d22c9024c952944873778e5717d58b">event listener challenge</a> with an input and updating the H1 </p>
        <p>did myReduce challenge and added <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/99bd799ef9fffdbca09d784c09675683">js fundamentals</a></p>
        <p>do <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/dd0db73c27b81aaf0cb8a0aedd09353f">function notation challenge</a> and then this <a href="https://gist.github.com/scottdixon/1db09b3261035b2a452c89e4aada2be1">isMatch challenge</a> as extra for morning tomorrow</p>
        <h2 id="nov-13"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-13">NOV 13</a></h2>
        <p>really tough day today</p>
        <p>callbacks are new to me but learnt heaps</p>
        <p>when i get home finish off q 3 then clean up notes</p>
        <p>apparently q 4 is extremely similar</p>
        <p>this explains <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52501745/making-my-own-foreach-javascript-element-is-not-defined">callbacks perfectly</a></p>
        <p>do a bit of what ruegen asked for in terms of different function notation</p>
        <p>these were the notes that i took for <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/a6963dc516d8b9376bd19d645b13ca18">callbacks</a>, will also be taking some notes for js fun</p>
        <p><a href="https://strava.app.link/ua5dw7P3NR">run</a> was lousy nothing too fantastic, it was hot and didn&#8217;t feel great but got through 9</p>
        <h2 id="nov-12"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-12">NOV 12</a></h2>
        <p>installing node, basics of javascript</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/348c25a8b9ca88f7d8a46d573076364a">this document</a> outlines the basics of javascript</p>
        <p>today was relatively comfortable but will get tougher tomorrow</p>
        <p>the basics of javascript are extremely similar to ruby</p>
        <p>run tomorrow and thursday, try and get out for at least 10k both times</p>
        <p>maybe do the albert park lake run tomorrow</p>
        <p>.splice(0, 1)</p>
        <p>replaces one element at the 0 position in the array, can also use it to insert into arrays</p>
        <h2 id="nov-11"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-11">NOV 11</a></h2>
        <p>till playing ball <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/harrisonnmalone/status/1061397486231674880">slow motion video</a></p>
        <p>big restructure of website today, removed anything unnecessary, if i need to access stuff again i can go back and look at github history, just have a path to posts</p>
        <p>resume removed and has style in style tag, will obviously need this again at some point but not for a while</p>
        <p>just using index page to refer to things, don't have a blog history page (no point to it) as it makes workflow annoying, just have the /posts/filename.html on the index page</p>
        <p>today created two new posts, one was about how i'm tackling <a href="/posts/library.html">my library</a> and one was my <a href="/posts/kids.html">first photos post called kids</a></p>
        <p>watched the first le wagon javascipt video, some good content the next few weeks will be fun</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrisonnmalone/status/1061520062425645056">run tweet</a>, not my best week this week but was busy with work</p>
        <p>using twitter app and tweetbot</p>
        <p>maybe delete tweetbot altogether from iphone, it&#8217;s just not a great iphone app for me</p>
        <p>on the ipad tweetbot 100% has a better design for me, still makes tweeting a bit hard, use both on the ipad</p>
        <h2 id="nov-10"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-10">NOV 10</a></h2>
        <p>went for a walk with mum along the beach</p>
        <p>mowed lawn and did cleaning</p>
        <p>work on javascript</p>
        <p><a href="https://strava.app.link/bSLWfLS2IR">run</a> felt great but its been a big rest in between, had a small batch of lasagna and curry for lunch</p>
        <h2 id="nov-9"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-9">NOV 9</a></h2>
        <p>presentations today</p>
        <p>everyone has submitted now</p>
        <p>switch to javascript</p>
        <p>try and go for a run before pub</p>
        <p>didn't end up happening üòê</p>
        <p>discrete maths <a href="https://gist.github.com/66e9d4a3ea198a39c6e6a510a4c9c60a">notes</a> out of today, need to do more on edgelist</p>
        <p>some thoughts off the presentations, some teams it felt a bit rushed, maybe best if teams stop coding thursday night, friday morning prepare slides and make up notes for pitch, treat it like a proper pitch in front of investors</p>
        <p>github seems to be an issue for quite a few groups, but they'll have learnt so much from the previous 2 weeks</p>
        <h2 id="nov-8"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-8">NOV 8</a></h2>
        <p>helping guy with his dashboard page, helping taylor and ross with their rendering issues</p>
        <p>helping xian with the readme</p>
        <p>tomorrow should have a bit of time to work on my own projects, weekend should be able to do some vanilla javascript</p>
        <p>maybe set up a website that has an index.html for the class notes, no feedback as yet from sally</p>
        <p>need to go for a run tonight</p>
        <p>other idea i had for my photo app was to create empty description objects (number would be based on .count on the photos) when you create an album</p>
        <p>you would loop through the descriptions in the view, album.descriptions</p>
        <p>in the album view you would then have an edit option which would allow you to add content</p>
        <p>$ heroku pg:reset DATABASE</p>
        <p>this command resets production database</p>
        <h2 id="nov-7"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-7">NOV 7</a></h2>
        <p>problems with the page build last night, i guess that's just a reality of using the github dns</p>
        <p>idea that i had in my head last night was to just have a constant and loop through it for the comments</p>
        <p>album.images.each_with_index</p> 
        <p>the constant could sit inside of the albums model</p>
        <p>this kind of works</p>
        <p>if i were to do the summary docs maybe launch my own website like this and host it somewhere</p>
        <p>wins today thus far were definitely solving the messaging system with guy and helping bash and xian with their rails structure</p>
        <p>going to trivia now, was nice seeing the guys and the bar is really close</p>
        <h2 id="nov-6"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-6">NOV 6</a></h2>
        <p>what if i met jake at the new starting spot for albert park lake, to catch the tram there only takes like 15 mins, that way can dump my stuff in his car and run full miles</p>
        <p>hit a few roadblocks trying to implement photos app, mainly to do with associations</p>
        <p>but did manage to deploy to heroku and connect amazon up which hadn't done much of</p>
        <p>needed to take a rest from running after 3 days on</p>
        <p>ipad keyboard starting to play up, buy a new one and test to see if it works alright </p>
        <p>mvp for photos is working, maybe chuck the notes that i had for the added extras into a post</p>
        <p>or just chuck them <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0tW9ets8VteEtiQlu0O9DEhHg#ideas_for_photos_app">here</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/bade9ce79c61a73caabd258dcd2b7be9">this</a> is the little bit of logic i wrote for the photo form and dynamic file upload frontend in javascipt</p>
        <h2 id="nov-5"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-5">NOV 5</a></h2>
        <p>wins of today were implementing search with corey, header for taylor, form for tiffany</p> 
        <p>stuff to work on include wizard for ross, drag and drop for lili, generally making something interactive for active storage file uploader</p> 
        <p><a href="https://strava.app.link/Wae4J09MAR">run</a> was pretty painful but took it slow, hot and three days in a row of running</p>
        <p>tomorrow work on wizard and javascript, tonight fix up website</p>
        <p>do i really need a a blog and podcast page when i can just post stuff on here, not really...</p>
        <p>also allows me to link maybe back to medium again, but obviously this would vary</p>
        <h2 id="nov-3"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-3">NOV 3</a></h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1942226912">run</a> today was really nice</p>
        <p>breakfast was vegemite toast, yogurt, banana and two cups of coffee</p>
        <p>maybe just having a easy morning contributed to the way i felt</p>
        <h2 id="nov-2"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-2">NOV 2</a></h2>
        <p>was nice seeing hamish again in the morning what are the chances</p>
        <p>not too sure what i should do in regards to the meeting this morning</p>
        <p>some good solutions for problems</p>
        <p>dependent: :nullify</p> 
        <p>to set foreign key id as nil when its dependency object is deleted</p>
        <p>will be a nice day tomorrow</p>
        <p>run, code, nan&#8217;s birthday</p>
        <p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk">retro pie</a> could be a bit of fun to configure</p>
        <p>maybe have this page as your homepage, also need to have latest date at the top</p>
        <p>write a blog post about what i do now, use that as essentially an about me page</p>
        <p>fix up podcast files</p>
        <h2 id="nov-1"><a class="header-link" href="#nov-1">NOV 1</a></h2>
        <p>better day today</p>
        <p>found a really <a href="https://www.melbournequarter.com/discover/news-and-events/green-and-way-up-high/">cool park</a> and helped correct some errors</p>
        <p>lots of form stuff</p>
        <p>worked out how to plugin bootstrap</p>
        <p>follow these <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem">docs</a></p>
        <p>some good work done for search this afternoon working on lilis app</p>
        <p>form_tag path, method: :get</p>
        <p>text_field_tag :query, params[:query], placeholder: "Find a movie"</p>
        <p>some issues with team dynamics</p>
        <p>rails app for my blog, naa i like having access to links too much, maybe something that allows me to write in markdown like that blog i built in jekyll a while a go, would be interesting to build that again</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1938944727">run</a> was really hard as ate chips beforehand</p>
        <p>handled the heat pretty well though</p>
        <p>felt pretty good today</p>
        <h2 id="oct-31"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-31">OCT 31</a></h2>
        <p>just some general debugging in the morning</p>
        <p>helped fix issues with devise and routes</p>
        <p>more bug fixing</p>
        <p>validations in devise</p>
        <p>most students now have a basic structure up</p>
        <p><a href="https://strava.app.link/wLxyJFGtsR">run</a> was solid</p>
        <p>felt like i moved pretty well</p>
        <p>was nice weather</p>
        <p>funny seeing hamish this morning</p>
        <p>need to look at bootstrap</p>
        <h2 id="oct-30"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-30">OCT 30</a></h2>
        <p>today was a pretty rough day</p>
        <p>couldn&#8217;t figure out model methods</p>
        <p>matt came back which was awesome</p>
        <p>helped lili at the end of today</p>
        <p>helped out a lot with configuring git and github</p>
        <p>still don&#8217;t understand erd&#8217;s that well</p>
        <p>pizza at lunch was good</p>
        <p>about to go for a run</p>
        <p>i have working copy on my phone and ipad now, really useful for pushing quick updates either to this diary or for a blog post</p>
        <h2 id="oct-29"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-29">OCT 29</a></h2>
        <p>scott ran through geocoder gem which was really interesting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAy3GO3dHRg&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a></p>
        <p>found that you can use .select to create a dropdown in a form helper </p>
        <p>student accidently uploaded .env file to github, should be okay </p>
        <p>made some progress on my own marketplace app</p>
        <p>learnt how to push and pull in the proper open source way using upstream remotes</p>
        <p>add remote to pull code from main repo</p>
        <p>$ git add remote upstream &lt;remote-url&gt;</p>
        <p>push branch to make pull request</p>
        <p>$ git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</p>
        <p>now working copy might be a legitimately powerful way of using my ipad, allows me to push anything up to harrisonmalone.com which is ideal for my diary and blog</p>
        <h2 id="oct-26"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-26">OCT 26</a></h2>
        <p>asset pipeline, how css and javascript get compressed </p>
        <p>what&#39;s a cdn (content distribution network)</p>
        <p>scott had this really interesting way of showing how much faster assets are to load when they&#39;re on the correct server </p>
        <p>sass</p>
        <p>student requests: rollbacks, images in emails (set heroku link in production yml file), hit counter</p>
        <p>basic hit counter <a href="https://youtu.be/vrWlM4EZM2Q">video</a></p>
        <p>released teams for assignment </p>
        <p>scott ran through assignment slides that outlined expectations and best practices </p>
        <p>people then divided into teams and started working out what they were going to build</p>
        <h2 id="oct-25"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-25">OCT 25</a></h2>
        <p>matrices and short challenge</p>
        <p>seeding the database</p>
        <p>deployment revision having to configure mailgun and stripe credientials on heroku</p>
        <p>action mailer with mailgun</p>
        <p>mailer <a href="https://youtu.be/o4s9QBxCkaI">walkthrough video</a> </p>
        <p>early academic meeting</p>
        <p>action mailer challenge was ensuring that email has details about product and user, key was to pass in the @product as a param in the method where you actually start the mailer method, so that you had access to it in the active mailer controller</p>
        <p>mailer <a href="https://youtu.be/G3s91679hAA">solution video</a></p>

        <p>more on crud without scaffolding</p>
        <p>complex associations, has many through</p>
        <p>the challenge was user can browse site to see courses</p>
        <p>user can register to become a user and buy a course, if a user buys a course, they can see the content</p>
        <p>so a user has many courses and a course has many users, join table needed</p>
        <p>stripe and courses <a href="https://youtu.be/DSh1lRZmrsA">challenge solution</a></p>
        <p>i think the better way of doing it is creating a model for the join table, creating join table objects</p>
        <p>did <a href="http://davidpots.com/rails/tutorial/development/2013/04/02/rails-basics-has-many-through.html">this tutorial</a> in the evening to refresh the join table idea </p>

        <p>level 8 in the morning</p>
        <p>explaining why we need Pundit gem and applying it to gumtree.com clone</p>
        <p>using pundit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpC7O3-Apu8&amp;feature=youtu.be">explanation video</a> </p>
        <p>creating a rails app with associations without scaffolding</p>
        <p>the challenge was creating a student with a name and notes</p>
        <p>then beast mode was creating an association between student and pizza model</p>
        <p>students found it difficult not having access to the scaffold and writing the controller methods themselves</p>
        <p>scott posted some great videos on crud without scaffold</p>
        <p>actions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX2Y3roDsKs&amp;feature=youtu.be">create</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE0xKz6S-o4&amp;feature=youtu.be">update</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32PjYp97IHc&amp;feature=youtu.be">delete</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/IbpBTVpCyQ4">refactor with before_action</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAo212QHkBk&amp;feature=youtu.be">refactor with link_to helpers and form partial</a></p>
        <p>important to remember for the form partial is that when we use the new and edit views (when we use resources :student) we don&#39;t have to pass in the associated route for the url value, it automatically knows that new view is linked to a create action and edit view is linked to an update action</p>

        <h2 id="oct-15"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-15">OCT 15</a></h2>
        <p>first day with scott</p>
        <p>rails basics, relationship between views controllers</p>
        <p>challenge mainly revolved around just setting an instance variable in the controller and getting it to show in the view</p>
        <p>built a basic instagram clone </p>
        <h2 id="oct-12"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-12">OCT 12</a></h2>
        <p>marked most of the portfolio assignments </p>
        <p>fixed up the rails rubric </p>
        <p>revising rails</p>
        <h2 id="oct-11"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-11">OCT 11</a></h2>
        <p>sat in on java bootcamp </p>
        <h2 id="oct-10"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-10">OCT 10</a></h2>
        <p>sat in on java bootcamp </p>
        <h2 id="oct-9"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-9">OCT 9</a></h2>
        <p>helped with css challenge </p>
        <p>ruby workshop with the students that came in</p>
        <p>info night for fast track</p>
        <h2 id="oct-8"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-8">OCT 8</a></h2>
        <p>beginning of the week break </p>
        <p>helped with tic tac toe </p>
        <h2 id="oct-5"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-5">OCT 5</a></h2>
        <p>rails generate models, views and controllers </p>
        <p>built a basic web app that allowed you to store books or movies</p>
        <p>the whole point of this was being able to configure routes, make controller methods that interacted with the corresponding view and run a migration</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/23215ba8fb0bf12cb5aee523281537da">this gist</a> ran through those challenges</p>
        <h2 id="oct-4"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-4">OCT 4</a></h2>
        <p>recap from what we did the day before (server and yield)</p>
        <p>mvc explanation </p>
        <p>rails and postgres install, this was a really tedius process, took up a whole chuck of time  </p>
        <p>finished off with a rails scaffold</p>
        <h2 id="oct-3"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-3">OCT 3</a></h2>
        <p>another kind of random day but it made sense it context </p>
        <p>we firstly looked at yield again and made sure that everyone understood yield at a decent level </p>
        <p>we then looked at File.read and converting CSV to a hash with a parsing ruby script</p>
        <p>we needed this to work for our WEBrick server </p>
        <p>our WEBrick server had a case statement in it which was kind of like a controller </p>
        <p>it interacted with our database and created instance variables which we could then use erb on </p>
        <h2 id="oct-2"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-2">OCT 2</a></h2>
        <p>Ruegen was away </p>
        <p>we used this as kind of a day to recap ruby and reinforce the basics of ruby before we moved on to more challenging concepts </p>
        <p>we did some ruby drills and the students completed a ruby test </p>
        <p>we then looked at some discrete maths concepts, different number bases, binary (base 2), converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal</p>
        <h2 id="oct-1"><a class="header-link" href="#oct-1">OCT 1</a></h2>
        <p>connecting migrations and models to database with <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">sequel</a> </p>
        <p>today was essentially understanding how a rakefile works at a simplistic level </p>
        <p>we also deep dived into .env and using sequel </p>
        <p>essentially the whole point was to actually hard code migrations that we could run to create tables for our database </p>
        <p>we also needed models for our app to connect with the database correctly</p>
        <h2 id="sep-28"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-28">SEP 28</a></h2>
        <p>public holiday </p>
        <h2 id="sep-27"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-27">SEP 27</a></h2>
        <p>looked at dbdesigner </p>
        <p>used dbdesigner to create the same erd as the day before </p>
        <p>then did some sql basics </p>
        <p>went through sql documentation </p>
        <p>created tables and viewed schema with sqlite </p>
        <h2 id="sep-26"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-26">SEP 26</a></h2>
        <p>entity relationship diagrams </p>
        <p>we did the pet shop example </p>
        <p>relationships </p>
        <p>one to many, many to one, many to many, using join tables with a many to many relationship</p>
        <p>use cases for the many to many, many patients have many appointments, many doctors have many appointments, join table is the appointments, patient_id and doctor_id </p>
        <p>students split into groups and sketched out their own erd </p>
        <p>i think keeping it really simple is better, probably made them go too far with it, like a fully fledged web app when they could have just made a kindergarten for example </p>
        <h2 id="sep-25"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-25">SEP 25</a></h2>
        <p>today we worked on a challenge for most of the day </p>
        <p>got our heads back into ruby again </p>
        <p>using bundler </p>
        <p>using the stripe gem </p>
        <p>pushing stripe charges to a csv and storing them </p>
        <h2 id="sep-24"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-24">SEP 24</a></h2>
        <p>portfolio presentations </p>
        <p>got through most of them quite quickly</p>
        <p>had issues with the connection to the projector from various students laptops, this needs to be fixed before another big presentation day</p>
        <h2 id="sep-21"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-21">SEP 21</a></h2>
        <p>last touches for porfolio projects </p>
        <p>stayed late to make sure everyone was happy with where they&#39;re at </p>
        <p>starting to build up the readme and the powerpoint slides, don&#39;t leave this till too late </p>
        <h2 id="sep-20"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-20">SEP 20</a></h2>
        <p>i think at this point we realised that a lot of students were still struggling with basic css and html concepts </p>
        <p>we had a css review class in the afternoon just to go through how to structure out an html skeleton </p>
        <p>you don&#39;t have to make your entire page grid, this is something that the students struggled with</p>
        <p>also working with svgs, should we even allow students to do this, maybe it&#39;s better to get them understanding fundamentals of web design first </p>
        <p>or do some challenges that utilise svgs </p>
        <h2 id="sep-19"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-19">SEP 19</a></h2>
        <p>portfolio project, starting the css</p>
        <p>helping debug any issues that studnets were having </p>
        <h2 id="sep-18"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-18">SEP 18</a></h2>
        <p>portfolio project released </p>
        <p>went through brief</p>
        <p>made sure figma designs were well fleshed out, correct color and typography choices </p>
        <h2 id="sep-17"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-17">SEP 17</a></h2>
        <p>in the morning most of the students headed to the park and did bio interviews </p>
        <p>i think that‚Äôs quite an effective way to get people who don‚Äôt already have a bio about themselves to develop something</p>
        <h2 id="sep-14"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-14">SEP 14</a></h2>
        <p>not too sure what we did today, probably css revision</p>
        <h2 id="sep-13"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-13">SEP 13</a></h2>
        <p>overcoming self doubt talk, was very poor</p>
        <h2 id="sep-12"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-12">SEP 12</a></h2>
        <p>covered css basics again, margin, padding, position</p>
        <p>watched the everything is a remix video </p>
        <p>me and matt went through questions with a level of ambiguity from the test</p>
        <p>students watched tutorials with crazy css and tried to implement them, not sure if this served a purpose towards developing a portfolio, it does kind of show what‚Äôs possible with css</p>
        <p>we then learnt about flexbox </p>
        <p>played the flexbox froggy game  </p>
        <h2 id="sep-11"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-11">SEP 11</a></h2>
        <p>implemented css on the pizza hut website </p>
        <p>watched a bunch of videos about typography</p>
        <p>ran through how figma works </p>
        <p>tokyo challenge, seemed to run okay</p>
        <p>i felt like we spent a bit too much time working through figma, it was almost 4PM before any of the groups actually got into css </p>
        <p>didn‚Äôt get a chance to see anyone present </p>
        <h2 id="sep-10"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-10">SEP 10</a></h2>
        <p>now we‚Äôre doing html </p>
        <p>in the morning knocked off a few more ruby fundamental challenges </p>
        <p>just some basic html markup tutorial stuff we‚Äôre doing in the morning </p>
        <p>not sure if we delivered html in the best way, some students were still quite confused</p>
        <p>looked at pizza hut website and implemented similar html markup </p>
        <h2 id="sep-7"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-7">SEP 7</a></h2>
        <p>we had a recruiter come in and talk to the students about finding work </p>
        <p>keep it simple, send a shitload of emails, do side projects </p>
        <p>this was sort of a free day to an extent, we didn‚Äôt come in until 10am due to fire testing</p>
        <p>we then went through matt‚Äôs test from the previous day, this was really helpful for a lot of people i think </p>
        <p>we should have done something similar to the last question but in saying that the students have seen the elements required to solve at least the simple answer (using a case statement and .uniq) so we can give out marks for that </p>
        <p>people were a bit stressed out about that last question but it should be okay</p>
        <p>it‚Äôs a really hard question if you go deep into it so we‚Äôll mark leniently</p>
        <h2 id="sep-6"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-6">SEP 6</a></h2>
        <p>everyone presented their projects, all went well</p>
        <p>people who prepared their speech it really showed and had a level of polish to things </p>
        <p>we did a recap on a bunch of ruby aspects in the afternoon and did one of matt‚Äôs tests </p>
        <p>had a ruby fundamentals lesson, the best people in the class have by in large finished the fundamentals now </p>
        <p>preparing for the next days test </p>
        <p>we really should have delved a lot deeper into the test, i should be doing the tests that  haven‚Äôt done just to ensure that everything is suitable to the standard we‚Äôre after </p>
        <p>the last question was way too difficult for 3 weeks in</p>
        <h2 id="sep-5"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-5">SEP 5</a></h2>
        <p>continuing on with terminal apps </p>
        <p>every group at least produced something of high quality but this was because we had high performers paired with those who needed help </p>
        <p>a lot of time spent fiddling with git and the READMEs when most people would have really benefited from just coding </p>
        <h2 id="sep-4"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-4">SEP 4</a></h2>
        <p>we launched into terminal apps, me and matt approved the ideas   </p>
        <p>at this point a few of the teams had almost coded the entire thing, maybe this is something we want to try and prevent next time </p>
        <p>one note on making the teams, at this point in the course some people are really struggling to wrap their heads around the ruby concepts, it will sometimes mean that a person of less competency does barely any coding because they don‚Äôt feel confident enough to contribute, i definitely felt like that when i was doing my own terminal app</p>
        <p>pretty much helped people with their terminal apps from that point on, the hard part of it was actually helping do the architecture of the app itself when we haven‚Äôt done mvc, most groups did it functionally and passed most of their methods into a module and called them in a main.rb file  </p>
        <h2 id="sep-3"><a class="header-link" href="#sep-3">SEP 3</a></h2>
        <p>this morning was a bit of a weird one as had ryan biggs coming in    </p>
        <p>we learnt about markdown and generally how to structure a README</p>
        <p>then we had the ryan biggs talk</p>
        <p>made teams for terminal apps and allowed those teams to brainstorm </p>
        <p>pitching ideas for terminal app</p>
        <p>did something quick on pair programming, i liked the rally car driver analogy </p>
        <p>did a whole thing on git and learnt about did the ssh config to connect to github </p>
        <h2 id="aug-31"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-31">AUG 31</a></h2>
        <p>running through private methods and inheritance today </p>
        <p>just kicking off with a look at how to read ruby docs </p>
        <p>also thinking about how different languages compile together</p>
        <p>really wasted quite a bit of time thinking about what metaphor or explaination you could use for inheritance the whole morning didn‚Äôt really run that great </p>
        <p>OOP still very confusing for quite a few people, this isn‚Äôt ideal </p>
        <p>people struggling to get through the challenge (it was a vehicle superclass, and a car and motorbike subclass) and call instance methods </p>
        <p>then we had our second mindfulness thing which was okay‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>finished off with another ruby fundamentals recap and a talk about how to do the terminal app </p>
        <h2 id="aug-30"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-30">AUG 30</a></h2>
        <p>the recap we‚Äôre doing this morning on class is really helpful</p>
        <p>covered instance variables and instance methods again </p>
        <p>now jumping into class variables with @@cars and self.number_of_cars </p>
        <p>class methods do something to the overall class, when you call self on a method within the a Car class self refers to Car</p>
        <p>when you use self within an instance method self refers to the instance itself </p>
        <p>now doing the continent, country, cities challenge</p>
        <p>many people found this to be quite difficult, i think the idea of nesting objects within objects was hard to grasp </p>
        <p>matt then went through a cd store example which was a clone of the continents example </p>
        <h2 id="aug-29"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-29">AUG 29</a></h2>
        <p>yesterday we got into classes which is what usually breaks people‚Äôs brains </p>
        <p>i thought the explanation was pretty strong </p>
        <p>students seemed to enjoy the hamburger explanation, the idea of the hamburger menu being the class and each individual hamburger being an instance  </p>
        <p>in saying that many people were struggling to grasp the idea of instances and calling instance methods on an instance</p>
        <p>i saw a few times where students would have their instance methods outside of the class body, this might need to be reinforced </p>
        <p>pushing each individual walk instance into the @walk_data array was challenging as well </p>
        <p>i‚Äôd say based on yesterday if you could work out how to chain the walk method together with self (tilly.walk.walk) you‚Äôd already gone pretty far </p>
        <h2 id="aug-28"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-28">AUG 28</a></h2>
        <p>code refactoring </p>
        <p>again going through how a method works </p>
        <p>using each to iterate through an array but not actually returning a new array</p>
        <p>we then went into learning about ruby gems and how to install them, where to find them etc </p>
        <p>doing something with the dark sky gem, kind of just tested out different ways of accessing stuff within the giant JSON object </p>
        <p>gave back the test</p>
        <p>we looked at the trump predictor answers </p>
        <p>we then looked at each individual questions in the test and worked through them, this was really helpful for the people that found it hard </p>
        <p>we then did some more of the ruby fundamentals, very much a varied standard, some people have almost finished the challenges already whereas others are still struggling to write a method </p>
        <p>we then did slightly more stuff on ruby gems and modules, modules are kind of a weird concept that isn‚Äôt too important, good to immediately get exposure to .self</p>
        <p>finished off by doing more challenges and helping people  </p>
        <h2 id="aug-27"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-27">AUG 27</a></h2>
        <p>played around with the items from the hash iteration challenge</p>
        <p>in the class did some simple methods</p>
        <p>putting something into a box and getting returning it</p>
        <p>the pig challenge starting to catch people out because they don&#39;t have each and map</p>
        <p>showed us yield, it basically stops the code and executes the block</p>
        <p>we&#39;re yielding within a method and then creating our own block with the same name as the method</p>
        <p>passing in stuff within the yield parameters and then printing that out in the block</p>
        <p>we then broke for lunch, the .each was a bit rushed as we covered it just before lunch when many students were already pretty overwhelmed</p>
        <p>implement methods that perform all of the basic arithmetic functions</p>
        <p>the pig challenge was pretty hard for a lot of people</p>
        <p>i think most people got there in the end but it would have been a lot more simple once they really understood map, definitely the first example of being comfortable with being uncomfortable </p>
        <p>many of the students did the first few math methods a bit weird which is totally understandable, it was more just a question of reading and understanding the question than a coding problem</p>
        <p>things get a bit harder now and that&#39;s totally okay</p>
        <h2 id="aug-24"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-24">AUG 24</a></h2>
        <p>different data types</p>
        <p>we touched on when to use case and when to use if/else</p>
        <p>now looking at arrays and index</p>
        <p>sets with discrete math</p>
        <p>went through indexes and assigning a new value to an array with index</p>
        <p>went into the challenges that involved inserting and deleting parts from an array</p>
        <p>more explanation for using while loops with a counter incrementor</p>
        <p>people found this challenge a bit difficult</p>
        <p>the reassignment part is difficult, the syntax can take people a bit to get use to</p>
        <p>using push in the same example just to re-explain how loops work</p>
        <p>maybe some of the stuff was unnecessary in terms of the different ways you could do push syntax</p>
        <p>and also the array within an array variable</p>
        <p>just know reassigning and the bang !</p>
        <p>showing the different variations you can run with sort and chaining methods together</p>
        <p>tested out sort using multiple arrays</p>
        <h2 id="aug-23"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-23">AUG 23</a></h2>
        <p>did boolean fundamentals
        comparison operators</p>
        <p>worked on the first set of challenges</p>
        <p>some students still struggling with conditional syntax and indentation but with more practise will get better
        case statements</p>
        <p>maybe spent too much time on case statements</p>
        <p>when students went back and did the challenges again they were using case statements for things that could have been solved far more simply with an if/else</p>
        <p>this was probably because case was fresher in their minds </p>
        <p>did while loops which overall went okay</p>
        <p>some students were again a bit confused with syntax, they weren‚Äôt wrapping their code they already had done in the while loop</p>
        <p>also the way some students answered the questions varied, over complicated nested case statements is what i saw a few times</p>
        <h2 id="aug-22"><a class="header-link" href="#aug-22">AUG 22</a></h2>
        <p>the recap of terminal commands went pretty well, i think people understand the idea of arguments and homebrew a lot better</p>
        <p>jumping into irb now</p>
        <p>data types working pretty well</p>
        <p>some nice examples of strings, integers and floats</p>
        <p>coercion, the &quot;1&quot; * 5 trick is something nice to see</p>
        <p>did some of the basic ruby challenges on canvas </p>
        <p>being able to open and configure vscode is really important so it was good to spend some time on it</p>
        <p>then we got into variables, i think all in all the variable discussion worked well, the box analogy was a nice touch</p>
        <p>the idea of re-assigning a variable to a different type of data is really important and i think we covered that well</p>
        <p>puts, print, p</p>
        <p>strip, chomp, gets</p>
        <p>the challenges all in all went quite well</p>
        <p>seemed like nearly everyone got at least half way through and that would mean that nearly everyone understands the basics of storing user input and then having to convert into an integer or a float to do math</p>
        <p>could be wise just to do a quick recap tomorrow morning before we jump into conditionals</p>
        <p>the recap Gretch posted on slack covers this</p>

        <p>maybe the commands that developers don&#39;t use so often aren&#39;t necessary especially when we didn&#39;t really have the correct documentation for them, pushd was an example of this</p>
        <p>so long as you can cd, touch, mkdir, ls, mv, rm you&#39;ll be fine</p>
        <p>maybe just teaching people how to use vim is a better solution when vim is something the students will almost always accidentally see, in saying that nano is more beginner friendly for the config files  </p>
        <p>i liked having the tree graph on the board, i think that made things far more simple in seeing the entire structure, the tree homebrew install was nice as well</p>
        <p>going step by step with the home brew installation worked quite well </p>
        <p>the installation of ruby was a bit rough, students were getting worried when things weren&#39;t working, but in saying that installing ruby is always a tedious experience</p>
        <p>students were worried for no reason, ruegen just wasn&#39;t up to that point in explaining things</p>
