      <h2>Who?</h2>
      <p>I'm a junior full stack developer teaching others how to code at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a>. I thrive on solving problems in Ruby, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/blog">write about</a> my experiences as a teacher and reflect on the code I'm working with. I try to keep up a <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/diary">daily report</a> of all things that happen in my day.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind a keyboard I'm out on the track <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/24750713">running</a>, recording a <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/podcast">podcast</a> with a couple of mates or spending time with my dog Tilly.</p>
      <p>My code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/harrisonmalone">GitHub</a>. If you'd like to get in contact I <a href="https://twitter.com/harrisonnmalone">tweet</a> a lot.</p>
