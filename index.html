      <h2>Who?</h2>
      <p>I'm a junior full stack developer teaching others how to code at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> in Melbourne. I thrive on solving problems in Ruby, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/blog">write about</a> my experiences as a teacher. It's an incredible role that I'm currently doing and I want to document as much as I can. I believe the best part of working in tech is having the chance to learn everyday.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind a keyboard I'm out on the track <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/24750713">running</a> or behind a microphone recording a <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/podcast">podcast</a> with a couple of mates.</p>
      <p>My code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/harrisonmalone">GitHub</a>.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to keep up with me I <a href="https://twitter.com/harrisonnmalone">tweet</a> a lot.</p>
