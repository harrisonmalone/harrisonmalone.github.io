          <h2>Code</h2>
          <h4>6 February 2018</h4>
          <p>I’m finally doing something that I’ve wanted to do for about 3 years. I’m coding. I’m focussed on learning a programming language (<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>) and making gains. It’s not easy. Nothing in life is however at least I’m enjoying the shit out of what I’m working on. The feeling that I’m building something; building a product and building up my own knowledge feels powerful. </p>

          <p>For a long time I’ve felt listless and unskilled. I’ve applied for job after job, never really knowing what I was doing. Should I apply for copywriting, journalism or research jobs? I did a Bachelor of Arts at a great university so I know I’m qualified to do a lot of work out there but its been tough finding the right fit.</p>
          
          <p>The thing is I hated my degree. I never hustled if I didn’t need to hustle. I didn’t network and didn’t really learn from the lecturers. I just did the course work and passed. That's a fault on my behalf and it's affecting my ability to find my feet career wise now. </p>
          
          <p>In the back of my mind I know I'll find work eventually. It'll be shitty but you have to start somewhere. But then there's also been this itch. It's deep down in my guts and my heart. This feeling that that I need to go back to school to learn how to code and develop. Yes, it’s this buzz thing and people are saying that everyone should learn how to code. But thats not the only reason why I’m interested in it. I’m interested in it because I’m fucking actually interested. I’ve always loved talking and writing about computers and software. I’ve loved playing around and tinkering with code. </p>
          
          <p>So I’m doing something about this itch. Finally. I’m going to go do a short course coding bootcamp at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>. I chose Le Wagon because I like everything they talk about in their FAQs section and it seems like far less bullshit than somewhere like <a href="https://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>. You learn Ruby and SQL. You learn more of the advanced CSS stuff (flexbox, grid). You get to pitch an idea. It’s everything I’ve wanted to do and more.</p>
          
          <p>I know I won’t be getting a developer or product job fresh out of the course. That’s impossible. But what I will make sure I get out of it is connections. Friendships with people in a similar boat to me, with similar interests and dreams. That’s really what I lacked from my university experience. Everyone was all over the shop in an Arts degree. There was no structure.</p>
          
          <p>It’s expensive to go out and do the course (10k) but I think it’s worth every penny. Life’s too short not to take chances and risks like this. And I need to do something about my career here and now because fuck; it’s better wasting some money than being depressed on the couch and numb with stresses from finding work. </p>
          
          <p>I feel like I’m getting a real hold of what I want. Making my own choices and being my own man. I’m a grown up and if I fail then so be it. It’s all on me. </p>
