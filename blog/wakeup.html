                <p>Today was better in terms of the wake up.</p>

                <p>Didn't end up getting the rails stuff done but no biggie I understood everything that was taught today.</p> 

                <p>Will need to revisit the stuff I wrote about git today as well as the ruby workshops that I'll need to run while Matt is gone.</p>

                <p>Need to practise more JavaScript before we get stuck into that ü§ê.</p>

                <p>All in all a good solid day.</p>
