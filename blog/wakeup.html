            <h1>Wake Up</h1>
            <p>Today was better in terms of the wake up.</p>

            <p>Didn't end up getting the rails stuff done but no biggie I understood everything that was taught today.</p> 

            <p>Will need to revisit <a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/dd7c1ac28a5021840ac3091009f88cdc" target="_blank">the stuff I wrote about Git</a> today as well as the ruby workshops that I'll need to run while Matt is gone.</p>

            <p>Need to practice more JavaScript before we get stuck into that ü§ê.</p>

            <p>All in all a good solid day.</p>
