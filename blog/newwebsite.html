          <h2>New Website</h2>
          <h4>1 January 2018</h4>
          <p>I think what holds me back a lot from being creative is that I’m so finicky. I’m so conscious of how things look rather than the value people might actually get from seeing my stuff. Whatever that stuff is (writing, music, audio) I hold back and when I finally attempt to publish it’s always a bit half baked because I’ve not put in my full focus. I’ve been distracted and tried to do something else. My mind has wandered and quality suffers.</p>

          <p>Maybe this is because there is something wrong with me. I’m just not good enough or talented enough to ever be a creative. To make money doing shit that I love. Having a sense of control.</p>
          
          <p>I’ve realised that having this control over my work is really important. Working for some dick that doesn’t trust me and I have no control. I want to be respected for what I do. For what I can offer the world and actually make a difference out there.</p>
          
          <p>That’s why I developed this website. This website gives me a base point. Everything is here. This one platform represents me and is representative of the skills I can provide.  I have agency over everything from the way it looks to what content appears. Nothing is done by a third party. It’s all me.</p>
          
          <p>What I’ve also realised in the past few weeks is that being depressed and grumpy all the time is a shitty way to live. I was mean to people who care for me. I was angry with the world and struggling because I’d lost touch with who I am and what I’m good at.</p>
          
          <p>Inside of me I’ve known for a long time what I’m good at. I’ve just never been gutsy enough to reach out and grab it by the balls. To actually act on my instincts.</p>
          
          <p>I love talking shit about sport and popular culture.</p>
          
          <p>I can write about it as well but informative writing just doesn’t really do it for me. I need the freedom to almost freestyle and spit on the mic. I think I’ve figured out a better way to present my audio work rather than just random YouTube videos. I have a strategy that will soon be revealed to the world.</p>
          
          <p>Audio stops you from constantly editing. I mean you can edit in post production but trimming little bits and pieces but it’s not like writing. Whatever comes out of your mouth is what you have to use. Your ability to be spontaneous and think of things to say on the spot becomes the most important thing.</p>
          
          <p>Audio also allows you to talk to people. I’m going to ask mates I know to help me improve as a creative. Help me be make good shit to listen to in a recorded conversation.</p>
          
          <p>My skills as a radio and podcast presenter is what I am. I can do these skills better than other people and make money from them. I have the equipment and the software that not many others have. I have the technical ability which is something I’ve lamented having a lack there of for a long time. I needed the technical not just the artistic.</p>
          
          <p>Being technical is also something that applied to my ability to code. And I want to certified for that ability. I have an arts degree yes but I want to get a software development diploma. A diploma is a step down but fuck it I don’t really care. </p>
          
          <p>I like being known for my ability to code and understand how a website works. So in 2018 I start afresh with this new website.</p>
