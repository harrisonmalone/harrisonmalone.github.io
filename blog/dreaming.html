<p>So life has kind of happened in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>I'd like to announce that I have a new gig. I'm to be an assistant educator at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au" target="_blank">Coder Academy</a> facilitating the next bootcamp which starts on the 20th of August and runs for a tad over 20 weeks. The role is ongoing and has the opportunity to progress into other bootcamp variations which Coder Academy run (such as <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/gentech" target="_blank">this one</a>).</p>

<p>This is a big moment in my life. A moment of vindication. A <a href="http://harrisonmalone.com/blog/code" target="_blank">post</a> I wrote earlier this year was all about why I'm taking a risk and committing full time to learning how to code. Reading that back after hearing the good news about this new job; I almost shed a tear.</p>

<p>I trusted my gut back then. I knew I enjoyed coding. I just didn't know where it would lead me and how hard it would be be. I decided to enroll at the <a href="http://lewagon.com" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a> bootcamp based on this gut feeling alone. It was fucking scary actually having to front up with the cash rather than relying on HEX. I think now (with hindsight) it was absolutely fucking worth it.</p>

<p>The first few weeks were incredibly stressful. Learning <a href="http://ruby-doc.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> (or any programming language) is a grind especially when you're doing it every day and compressing content down to a bootcamp format.</p>

<p>In saying this, it's a great way to learn. You're forced to be uncomfortable and that's life. Work is uncomfortable and success is uncomfortable. Your brain will hurt a lot of the time but I'm telling you that it's worth it. </p>

<p>I now have a family and a network within the Melbourne web development community. The meet ups and events that are run for free are awesome for making new friends and improving as a developer. It's an amazing community. I don't believe that there's many other industries with the type of community that developers in Melbourne have.</p>

<p>When I walked out of the interview I was kind of telling myself "what just happened". I was shaking from joy. I could have high fived a random person in the street. This is my life now. I have a job that I'm really proud of. A role that I'm really really excited to start.</p>

<p>So that's about it. Now the real work begins.</p>
