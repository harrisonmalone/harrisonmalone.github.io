          <h2>Reminders</h2>
          <h4>13 February 2018</h4>
          <p>I’m using Siri more than ever in my general workflow. Why you might ask? Well I use Siri all the time to set reminders. Yes the same reminders app which for most people is tucked away in a folder or deleted completely to save storage. That shitty reminders app as it's often known.</p>

          <p>Luckily, because Siri does reminders really well you barely have to even visit this ancient relic of Apple design. Siri itself is the reminders app. Built in is this secret intuitive reminders system which I feel is underrated and more likely that not (I don’t have Apple usage stats) barely used. It’s simple software and it just works. It’s Apple doing what it does best. </p>

          <p>You might not be as forgetful as me but I’m sure most people have some kind reminders system. Writing on your hand for example. I set reminders 80% of the time by typing to Siri (oh and seriously <a href="https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-enable-type-to-siri-in-ios-11/" target="_blank">enable type to Siri</a> already). On iOS all you have to do is hold down the home button (side button for iPhone X) and type in your reminder. </p>

          <p>An example of a highly used type to Siri reminder for me is “remind me to put the washing on the line at 3PM”. From this string Siri automatically figures out that the message you want printed is “put the washing on the line” and to set a push notification up for 3PM. Simple and fast. Remembering the prompt structure is the trickiest bit (remind me to [do something] at [time/date]) but it becomes second nature after a few attempts. I also set reminders on OS X using the same prompt and by activating Siri with the command-space hot key.</p>

          <p>I must mention here that the iPad type to Siri is particularly nice. I think this was an <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci" target="_blank">@viticci</a> tweet but it was something along the lines of type to Siri on iPad is like having a smart command line. I love this ability to type in one word and get something useful back.   </p>

          <p>Yes, I also use my voice to set reminders and this will generally be when I’m driving or if I have my hands full (hey Siri works even if you have your phone in your pocket). I actually think learning the type to Siri commands allows you to use your voice better. Siri will work better when you as the user learn how to speak the Siri language. </p>

          <p>I mentioned before that you don’t need to even go into the shitty reminders app. By simply imputing the string “reminders” to Siri you get your list of reminders and you can check them from within the Siri interface. Useful huh. </p>

          <p>This use of Siri also inspired me to jump back on the iCal bandwagon (or is it just called Apple Calendars now?). It's weird because I still think Google Calendar’s UX is far better. It’s prettier, uses Google Maps and not Apple Maps and has a reminder system integrated within it.  But and it’s a big but... notifications can be a bit dodgy for Google apps on iOS and you don’t get Siri integration.   </p>

          <p>I liked how you could set reminders from within both Google Inbox and Google Calendar but there was serious problems with the way notifications for desktop and notifications for iOS talked to each other. If you set up a reminder on one it wouldn’t appear on the other.</p>

          <p>I can type to Siri “schedule lunch with Mike on Friday at 4PM” and it makes a one hour event. If I then set up a calendar notification, I know I’ll get a notification across all my devices (Mac and iOS). Reliable push notifications is the biggest part of this puzzle for me. Even if some things could be improved on both Apple and Google’s behalf, Apple wins out because of this notification reliability.   </p>

          <p>Hopefully Apple revamps the design of Calendar and Reminders at the next WWDC as it’s severely needed. They spoke about these problems on <a href="https://overcast.fm/+CdSpFx40" target="_blank">ATP</a> this week, as well as floating the idea of having a Reminders Pro option, similar to what Apple have done with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204987" target="_blank">Notes</a>. I like this Pro idea a lot. </p>

          <p>Siri gets bashed all the time and rightly so, but I don’t understand why Apple doesn’t sell something like this “set reminder” voice command more in say an advertisement for HomePod or AirPods. It’s a great feature; just most people don’t know about it. </p>
