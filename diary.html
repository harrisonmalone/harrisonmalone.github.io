        <p>maybe the commands that developers don&#39;t use so often aren&#39;t necessary especially when we didn&#39;t really have the correct documentation for them, pushd was an example of this</p>
        <p>so long as you can cd, touch, mkdir, ls, mv, rm you&#39;ll be fine</p>
        <p>maybe just teaching people how to use vim is a better solution when vim is something the students will almost always accidentally see, in saying that nano is more beginner friendly for the config files  </p>
        <p>i liked having the tree graph on the board, i think that made things far more simple in seeing the entire structure, the tree homebrew install was nice as well</p>
        <p>going step by step with the home brew installation worked quite well </p>
        <p>the installation of ruby was a bit rough, students were getting worried when things weren&#39;t working, but in saying that installing ruby is always a tedious experience</p>
        <p>students were worried for no reason, ruegen just wasn&#39;t up to that point in explaining things</p>
        <h2 id="aug-22">AUG 22</h2>
        <p>the recap of terminal commands went pretty well, i think people understand the idea of arguments and homebrew a lot better</p>
        <p>jumping into irb now</p>
        <p>data types working pretty well</p>
        <p>some nice examples of strings, integers and floats</p>
        <p>coercion, the &quot;1&quot; * 5 trick is something nice to see</p>
        <p>did some of the basic ruby challenges on canvas </p>
        <p>being able to open and configure vscode is really important so it was good to spend some time on it</p>
        <p>then we got into variables, i think all in all the variable discussion worked well, the box analogy was a nice touch</p>
        <p>the idea of re-assigning a variable to a different type of data is really important and i think we covered that well</p>
        <p>puts, print, p</p>
        <p>strip, chomp, gets</p>
        <p>the challenges all in all went quite well</p>
        <p>seemed like nearly everyone got at least half way through and that would mean that nearly everyone understands the basics of storing user input and then having to convert into an integer or a float to do math</p>
        <p>could be wise just to do a quick recap tomorrow morning before we jump into conditionals</p>
        <p>the recap Gretch posted on slack covers this</p>
        <h2 id="aug-23">AUG 23</h2>
        <p>did boolean fundamentals
        comparison operators</p>
        <p>worked on the first set of challenges</p>
        <p>some students still struggling with conditional syntax and indentation but with more practise will get better
        case statements</p>
        <p>maybe spent too much time on case statements</p>
        <p>when students went back and did the challenges again they were using case statements for things that could have been solved far more simply with an if/else</p>
        <p>this was probably because case was fresher in their minds </p>
        <p>did while loops which overall went okay</p>
        <p>some students were again a bit confused with syntax, they weren’t wrapping their code they already had done in the while loop</p>
        <p>also the way some students answered the questions varied, over complicated nested case statements is what i saw a few times</p>
        <h2 id="aug-24">AUG 24</h2>
        <p>different data types</p>
        <p>we touched on when to use case and when to use if/else</p>
        <p>now looking at arrays and index</p>
        <p>sets with discrete math</p>
        <p>went through indexes and assigning a new value to an array with index</p>
        <p>went into the challenges that involved inserting and deleting parts from an array</p>
        <p>more explanation for using while loops with a counter incrementor</p>
        <p>people found this challenge a bit difficult</p>
        <p>the reassignment part is difficult, the syntax can take people a bit to get use to</p>
        <p>using push in the same example just to re-explain how loops work</p>
        <p>maybe some of the stuff was unnecessary in terms of the different ways you could do push syntax</p>
        <p>and also the array within an array variable</p>
        <p>just know reassigning and the bang !</p>
        <p>showing the different variations you can run with sort and chaining methods together</p>
        <p>tested out sort using multiple arrays</p>
        <h2 id="aug-27">AUG 27</h2>
        <p>played around with the items from the hash iteration challenge</p>
        <p>in the class did some simple methods</p>
        <p>putting something into a box and getting returning it</p>
        <p>the pig challenge starting to catch people out because they don&#39;t have each and map</p>
        <p>showed us yield, it basically stops the code and executes the block</p>
        <p>we&#39;re yielding within a method and then creating our own block with the same name as the method</p>
        <p>passing in stuff within the yield parameters and then printing that out in the block</p>
        <p>we then broke for lunch, the .each was a bit rushed as we covered it just before lunch when many students were already pretty overwhelmed</p>
        <p>implement methods that perform all of the basic arithmetic functions</p>
        <p>the pig challenge was pretty hard for a lot of people</p>
        <p>i think most people got there in the end but it would have been a lot more simple once they really understood map, definitely the first example of being comfortable with being uncomfortable </p>
        <p>many of the students did the first few math methods a bit weird which is totally understandable, it was more just a question of reading and understanding the question than a coding problem</p>
        <p>things get a bit harder now and that&#39;s totally okay</p>
        <h2 id="aug-28">AUG 28</h2>
        <p>code refactoring </p>
        <p>again going through how a method works </p>
        <p>using each to iterate through an array but not actually returning a new array</p>
        <p>we then went into learning about ruby gems and how to install them, where to find them etc </p>
        <p>doing something with the dark sky gem, kind of just tested out different ways of accessing stuff within the giant JSON object </p>
        <p>gave back the test</p>
        <p>we looked at the trump predictor answers </p>
        <p>we then looked at each individual questions in the test and worked through them, this was really helpful for the people that found it hard </p>
        <p>we then did some more of the ruby fundamentals, very much a varied standard, some people have almost finished the challenges already whereas others are still struggling to write a method </p>
        <p>we then did slightly more stuff on ruby gems and modules, modules are kind of a weird concept that isn’t too important, good to immediately get exposure to .self</p>
        <p>finished off by doing more challenges and helping people  </p>
        <h2 id="aug-29">AUG 29</h2>
        <p>yesterday we got into classes which is what usually breaks people’s brains </p>
        <p>i thought the explanation was pretty strong </p>
        <p>students seemed to enjoy the hamburger explanation, the idea of the hamburger menu being the class and each individual hamburger being an instance  </p>
        <p>in saying that many people were struggling to grasp the idea of instances and calling instance methods on an instance</p>
        <p>i saw a few times where students would have their instance methods outside of the class body, this might need to be reinforced </p>
        <p>pushing each individual walk instance into the @walk_data array was challenging as well </p>
        <p>i’d say based on yesterday if you could work out how to chain the walk method together with self (tilly.walk.walk) you’d already gone pretty far </p>
        <h2 id="aug-30">AUG 30</h2>
        <p>the recap we’re doing this morning on class is really helpful</p>
        <p>covered instance variables and instance methods again </p>
        <p>now jumping into class variables with @@cars and self.number_of_cars </p>
        <p>class methods do something to the overall class, when you call self on a method within the a Car class self refers to Car</p>
        <p>when you use self within an instance method self refers to the instance itself </p>
        <p>now doing the continent, country, cities challenge</p>
        <p>many people found this to be quite difficult, i think the idea of nesting objects within objects was hard to grasp </p>
        <p>matt then went through a cd store example which was a clone of the continents example </p>
        <h2 id="aug-31">AUG 31</h2>
        <p>running through private methods and inheritance today </p>
        <p>just kicking off with a look at how to read ruby docs </p>
        <p>also thinking about how different languages compile together</p>
        <p>really wasted quite a bit of time thinking about what metaphor or explaination you could use for inheritance the whole morning didn’t really run that great </p>
        <p>OOP still very confusing for quite a few people, this isn’t ideal </p>
        <p>people struggling to get through the challenge (it was a vehicle superclass, and a car and motorbike subclass) and call instance methods </p>
        <p>then we had our second mindfulness thing which was okay…</p>
        <p>finished off with another ruby fundamentals recap and a talk about how to do the terminal app </p>
        <h2 id="sep-3">SEP 3</h2>
        <p>this morning was a bit of a weird one as had ryan biggs coming in    </p>
        <p>we learnt about markdown and generally how to structure a README</p>
        <p>then we had the ryan biggs talk</p>
        <p>made teams for terminal apps and allowed those teams to brainstorm </p>
        <p>pitching ideas for terminal app</p>
        <p>did something quick on pair programming, i liked the rally car driver analogy </p>
        <p>did a whole thing on git and learnt about did the ssh config to connect to github </p>
        <h2 id="sep-4">SEP 4</h2>
        <p>we launched into terminal apps, me and matt approved the ideas   </p>
        <p>at this point a few of the teams had almost coded the entire thing, maybe this is something we want to try and prevent next time </p>
        <p>one note on making the teams, at this point in the course some people are really struggling to wrap their heads around the ruby concepts, it will sometimes mean that a person of less competency does barely any coding because they don’t feel confident enough to contribute, i definitely felt like that when i was doing my own terminal app</p>
        <p>pretty much helped people with their terminal apps from that point on, the hard part of it was actually helping do the architecture of the app itself when we haven’t done mvc, most groups did it functionally and passed most of their methods into a module and called them in a main.rb file  </p>
        <h2 id="sep-5">SEP 5</h2>
        <p>continuing on with terminal apps </p>
        <p>every group at least produced something of high quality but this was because we had high performers paired with those who needed help </p>
        <p>a lot of time spent fiddling with git and the READMEs when most people would have really benefited from just coding </p>
        <h2 id="sep-6">SEP 6</h2>
        <p>everyone presented their projects, all went well</p>
        <p>people who prepared their speech it really showed and had a level of polish to things </p>
        <p>we did a recap on a bunch of ruby aspects in the afternoon and did one of matt’s tests </p>
        <p>had a ruby fundamentals lesson, the best people in the class have by in large finished the fundamentals now </p>
        <p>preparing for the next days test </p>
        <p>we really should have delved a lot deeper into the test, i should be doing the tests that  haven’t done just to ensure that everything is suitable to the standard we’re after </p>
        <p>the last question was way too difficult for 3 weeks in</p>
        <h2 id="sep-7">SEP 7</h2>
        <p>we had a recruiter come in and talk to the students about finding work </p>
        <p>keep it simple, send a shitload of emails, do side projects </p>
        <p>this was sort of a free day to an extent, we didn’t come in until 10am due to fire testing</p>
        <p>we then went through matt’s test from the previous day, this was really helpful for a lot of people i think </p>
        <p>we should have done something similar to the last question but in saying that the students have seen the elements required to solve at least the simple answer (using a case statement and .uniq) so we can give out marks for that </p>
        <p>people were a bit stressed out about that last question but it should be okay</p>
        <p>it’s a really hard question if you go deep into it so we’ll mark leniently</p>
        <h2 id="sep-10">SEP 10</h2>
        <p>now we’re doing html </p>
        <p>in the morning knocked off a few more ruby fundamental challenges </p>
        <p>just some basic html markup tutorial stuff we’re doing in the morning </p>
        <p>not sure if we delivered html in the best way, some students were still quite confused</p>
        <p>looked at pizza hut website and implemented similar html markup </p>
        <h2 id="sep-11">SEP 11</h2>
        <p>implemented css on the pizza hut website </p>
        <p>watched a bunch of videos about typography</p>
        <p>ran through how figma works </p>
        <p>tokyo challenge, seemed to run okay</p>
        <p>i felt like we spent a bit too much time working through figma, it was almost 4PM before any of the groups actually got into css </p>
        <p>didn’t get a chance to see anyone present </p>
        <h2 id="sep-12">SEP 12</h2>
        <p>covered css basics again, margin, padding, position</p>
        <p>watched the everything is a remix video </p>
        <p>me and matt went through questions with a level of ambiguity from the test</p>
        <p>students watched tutorials with crazy css and tried to implement them, not sure if this served a purpose towards developing a portfolio, it does kind of show what’s possible with css</p>
        <p>we then learnt about flexbox </p>
        <p>played the flexbox froggy game  </p>
        <h2 id="sep-17">SEP 17</h2>
        <p>in the morning most of the students headed to the park and did bio interviews </p>
        <p>i think that’s quite an effective way to get people who don’t already have a bio about themselves to develop something</p>
        <h2 id="sep-18">SEP 18</h2>
        <p>portfolio project released </p>
        <p>went through brief</p>
        <p>made sure figma designs were well fleshed out, correct color and typography choices </p>
        <h2 id="sep-19">SEP 19</h2>
        <p>portfolio project, starting the css</p>
        <p>helping debug any issues that studnets were having </p>
        <h2 id="sep-20">SEP 20</h2>
        <p>i think at this point we realised that a lot of students were still struggling with basic css and html concepts </p>
        <p>we had a css review class in the afternoon just to go through how to structure out an html skeleton </p>
        <p>you don&#39;t have to make your entire page grid, this is something that the students struggled with</p>
        <p>also working with svgs, should we even allow students to do this, maybe it&#39;s better to get them understanding fundamentals of web design first </p>
        <p>or do some challenges that utilise svgs </p>
        <h2 id="sep-21">SEP 21</h2>
        <p>last touches for porfolio projects </p>
        <p>stayed late to make sure everyone was happy with where they&#39;re at </p>
        <p>starting to build up the readme and the powerpoint slides, don&#39;t leave this till too late </p>
        <h2 id="sep-24">SEP 24</h2>
        <p>portfolio presentations </p>
        <p>got through most of them quite quickly </p>
        <p>had issues with the connection to the projector from various students laptops, this needs to be fixed before another big presentation day  </p>
        <h2 id="sep-25">SEP 25</h2>
        <p>today we worked on a challenge for most of the day </p>
        <p>got our heads back into ruby again </p>
        <p>using bundler </p>
        <p>using the stripe gem </p>
        <p>pushing stripe charges to a csv and storing them </p>
        <h2 id="sep-26">SEP 26</h2>
        <p>entity relationship diagrams </p>
        <p>we did the pet shop example </p>
        <p>relationships </p>
        <p>one to many, many to one, many to many, using join tables with a many to many relationship</p>
        <p>use cases for the many to many, many patients have many appointments, many doctors have many appointments, join table is the appointments, patient_id and doctor_id </p>
        <p>students split into groups and sketched out their own erd </p>
        <p>i think keeping it really simple is better, probably made them go too far with it, like a fully fledged web app when they could have just made a kindergarten for example </p>
        <h2 id="sep-27">SEP 27</h2>
        <p>looked at dbdesigner </p>
        <p>used dbdesigner to create the same erd as the day before </p>
        <p>then did some sql basics </p>
        <p>went through sql documentation </p>
        <p>created tables and viewed schema with sqlite </p>
        <h2 id="sep-28">SEP 28</h2>
        <p>public holiday </p>
        <h2 id="oct-1">OCT 1</h2>
        <p>connecting migrations and models to database with <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">sequel</a> </p>
        <p>today was essentially understanding how a rakefile works at a simplistic level </p>
        <p>we also deep dived into .env and using sequel </p>
        <p>essentially the whole point was to actually hard code migrations that we could run to create tables for our database </p>
        <p>we also needed models for our app to connect with the database correctly</p>
        <h2 id="oct-2">OCT 2</h2>
        <p>Ruegen was away </p>
        <p>we used this as kind of a day to recap ruby and reinforce the basics of ruby before we moved on to more challenging concepts </p>
        <p>we did some ruby drills and the students completed a ruby test </p>
        <p>we then looked at some discrete maths concepts, different number bases, binary (base 2), converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal</p>
        <h2 id="oct-3">OCT 3</h2>
        <p>another kind of random day but it made sense it context </p>
        <p>we firstly looked at yield again and made sure that everyone understood yield at a decent level </p>
        <p>we then looked at File.read and converting CSV to a hash with a parsing ruby script</p>
        <p>we needed this to work for our WEBrick server </p>
        <p>our WEBrick server had a case statement in it which was kind of like a controller </p>
        <p>it interacted with our database and created instance variables which we could then use erb on </p>
        <h2 id="oct-4">OCT 4</h2>
        <p>recap from what we did the day before (server and yield)</p>
        <p>mvc explanation </p>
        <p>rails and postgres install, this was a really tedius process, took up a whole chuck of time  </p>
        <p>finished off with a rails scaffold</p>
        <h2 id="oct-5">OCT 5</h2>
        <p>rails generate models, views and controllers </p>
        <p>built a basic web app that allowed you to store books or movies</p>
        <p>the whole point of this was being able to configure routes, make controller methods that interacted with the corresponding view and run a migration</p>
        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/23215ba8fb0bf12cb5aee523281537da">this gist</a> ran through those challenges</p>
        <h2 id="oct-8">OCT 8</h2>

        <p>level 8 in the morning</p>
        <p>explaining why we need Pundit gem and applying it to gumtree.com clone</p>

        <p>creating a rails app with associations without scaffolding</p>
        <p>the challenge was creating a student with a name and notes</p>
        <p>then beast mode was creating an association between student and pizza model</p>
        <p>students found it difficult not having access to the scaffold and writing the controller methods themselves</p>
        <p>scott posted some great videos on crud without scaffold</p>
        <p>actions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX2Y3roDsKs&amp;feature=youtu.be">create</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE0xKz6S-o4&amp;feature=youtu.be">update</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32PjYp97IHc&amp;feature=youtu.be">delete</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/IbpBTVpCyQ4">refactor with before_action</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAo212QHkBk&amp;feature=youtu.be">refactor with link_to helpers and form partial</a></p>
        <p>important to remember for the form partial is that when we use the new and edit views (when we use resources :student) we don&#39;t have to pass in the associated route for the url value, it automatically knows that new view is linked to a create action and edit view is linked to an update action</p>

        <p>stripe</p>
        <p>applying stripe <a href="https://youtu.be/XlUSh1LPCxI">explainer video</a></p>
        <p>more on crud without scaffolding</p>
        <p>complex associations, has many through</p>
        <p>the challenge was user can browse site to see courses</p>
        <p>user can register to become a user and buy a course, if a user buys a course, they can see the content</p>
        <p>so a user has many courses and a course has many users, join table needed</p>
        <p>stripe and courses <a href="https://youtu.be/DSh1lRZmrsA">challenge solution</a></p>
        <p>i think the better way of doing it is creating a model for the join table, creating join table objects</p>
        <p>did <a href="http://davidpots.com/rails/tutorial/development/2013/04/02/rails-basics-has-many-through.html">this tutorial</a> in the evening to refresh the join table idea </p>

        <p>matrices and short challenge</p>
        <p>seeding the database</p>
        <p>deployment revision having to configure mailgun and stripe credientials on heroku</p>
        <p>action mailer with mailgun</p>
        <p>mailer <a href="https://youtu.be/o4s9QBxCkaI">walkthrough video</a> </p>
        <p>early academic meeting</p>
        <p>action mailer challenge was ensuring that email has details about product and user, key was to pass in the @product as a param in the method where you actually start the mailer method, so that you had access to it in the active mailer controller</p>

        <p>asset pipeline, how css and javascript get compressed </p>
        <p>what&#39;s a cdn (content distribution network)</p>
        <p>scott had this really interesting way of showing how much faster assets are to load when they&#39;re on the correct server </p>
        <p>sass</p>
        <p>student requests: rollbacks, images in emails (set heroku link in production yml file), hit counter</p>
        <p>basic hit counter <a href="https://youtu.be/vrWlM4EZM2Q">video</a></p>
        <p>released teams for assignment </p>
        <p>scott ran through assignment slides that outlined expectations and best practices </p>
        <p>people then divided into teams and started working out what they were going to build</p>
        <h2 id="oct-29">OCT 29</h2>
        <p>scott ran through geocoder gem which was really interesting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAy3GO3dHRg&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a></p>
        <p>found that you can use .select to create a dropdown in a form helper </p>
        <p>student accidently uploaded .env file to github, should be okay </p>
        <p>made some progress on my own marketplace app</p>
        <p>learnt how to push and pull in the proper open source way using upstream remotes</p>
        <p>add remote to pull code from main repo</p>
        <pre><code>$ git add remote upstream &lt;remote-url&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>push branch to make pull request</p>
        <pre><code>$ git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>now working copy might be a legitimately powerful way of using my ipad, allows me to push anything up to harrisonmalone.com which is ideal for my diary and blog</p>

        <p>today was a pretty rough day</p>
        <p>couldn&#8217;t figure out model methods</p>
        <p>matt came back which was awesome</p>
        <p>helped lili at the end of today</p>
        <p>helped out a lot with configuring git and github</p>
        <p>still don&#8217;t understand erd&#8217;s that well</p>
        <p>pizza at lunch was good</p>
        <p>about to go for a run</p>
        <p>i have working copy on my phone and ipad now, really useful for pushing quick updates either to this diary or for a blog post</p>

        <p>rails app for my blog, naa i like having access to links too much, maybe something that allows me to write in markdown like that blog i built in jekyll a while a go, would be interestig to build that again</p>
