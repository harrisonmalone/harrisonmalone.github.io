        <p>Precision is key to me. I think that might be a reason why I like to code. I like things that have a correct way or method; that don't have a subjective solution.</p>
        <p>An example of this came to me today when I was thinking about the differences between guitar and piano. I was using the Simply Piano app reading sheet music and thought to myself that piano sheet music is so much more precise that reading a guitar tab. You play in one set way. Each note has a set time and each song a set tempo. Left and right hand. Treble and bass.</p>
        <p>There's no subjectivity. You play and practice and you make it perfect.</p>
