        <p>A few weeks ago my iPhone 6s had a battery replacement. This was a huge win in terms of the usage I&#8217;m getting out of the phone. Even when I make errors such as last night (I forgot to put it on charge) I still have 31% the following morning for the train ride in. This simply wouldn&#8217;t have happened with the old battery (it would be dead) and that's almost worth the $75 replacement fee alone.</p>
        <p>AirPods continue to be one of the best products I've ever used and have totally changed the way I consume music and podcasts. They are just so nice to carry around in your pocket and have them constantly charged and ready to go. I remember reading a tweet (that I now can't find to link) a few weeks back talking about how if Apple open up the API for AirPods then we'll see some interesting use cases for audio in third party apps. This applies to things like the double tap gesture. Imagine if all apps had the ability to utilise this feature.</p>
        <p>I can envision Twitter having a bot reading through all your tweets in some kind of elegant way and then you liking or retweeting using this gesture. Audio will have a big year because the AirPods are still growing in popularity.</p>
        <p>I&#8217;d love to start using the iPad more as a musical instrument through a bluetooth keyboard. <a href="https://www.cme-pro.com/xkey-air/">This one</a> from CME would be pretty sweet. My random product idea from Apple would be to make this exact keyboard but with literally no latency. I think that they would able to achieve this with the use of the W2 chip that&#8217;s in the AirPods. I&#8217;m still getting great usage out of the iPad as a get home and chill with it device. It&#8217;s just a perfect size and weight to carry with me around the house and use kind of like a portable wireless speaker (the built in speakers are excellent). One thing that could do with a replacement is the keyboard but it&#8217;s still going along okay; just a bit buggy sometimes with the cmd key being stuck on. I&#8217;m not sure if this issue is hardware or software though.</p>
        <p>One other use case for an iPad I thought of last night would be to use it as a photo editing device. It would be fun to play around with and learn how an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8">Darkroom</a> works.</p>
        <p>I need a new Mac. Still not entirely sold on whether to go Pro or Air but my affinity for the Air can&#8217;t be undersold. The Air changed my life and it&#8217;s still a brilliant computer 6 years since I received it for Christmas. This machine is purely for work as everything that I currently do at home is done with the iPad. The iPad is my home and do fun stuff with device. The Mac is my work machine to write code on. </p>
