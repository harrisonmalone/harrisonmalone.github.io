        <p>The xkey situation is an interesting one. On the one hand it&#8217;s a beautiful product that I think I&#8217;d get a lot of enjoyment out of but how much would I actually use it. Would it be away in the cupboard on weeks where I&#8217;m busy at work or if I have a podcast to record or a big running week.</p>
        <p>There&#8217;s also the fact that I'm keen on learning specifically piano and there&#8217;s a perfectly good piano in the house already that just needs to be tuned up a bit. This is what makes my decision; I think I should put a hold on getting the xkey until I practice on the big piano for a while.</p>
        <p>The priority in terms of products to buy should be a new Mac. This is the most important item in my possession and it needs to be updated at some stage this year. You could even invest a bit of money depending on some  guidance I get from family.</p>
        <p>In terms of learning piano, get the thing tuned at some stage as it's quite dodgy as it stands. You should also try out some of the piano apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/simply-piano-by-joytunes/id1019442026?mt=8">Simply Piano</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/flowkey/id1020357408?mt=8">flowkey</a>.</p>
