        <p>The text lagging issue in safari was an interesting issue. I feel as if I could almost report a radar. The fix was clearing out the cookies and search history.</p>
        <p>If the iPad isn't a speedy way to browse the web then all its good at is playing piano and listening to podcasts.</p>
        <p>I think the best thing to do is to buy the <a href="https://djcity.com.au/product/korg-microkey2-air-61-key-controller/">Korg keyboard</a>. Seems like there are some excellent synth iOS apps out there. Dream would be to have the AirPods in after a day at work and play the keys. Would probably store it in the study. The price of the Korg is also much more realistic.</p>
        <p>I could go to the store and fully test out my workflow with it. Bring the iPad in and play with synth apps as well as Simply Piano.</p>
