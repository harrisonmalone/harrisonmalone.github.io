        <p>Was thinking this morning about making one of those colour reaction games.</p>
        <p>For example, red comes up on the screen (as a string) and you have to click on it before the two seconds runs up. You also have two other colours on the screen to try and confuse the user.</p>
        <p>The other idea I had was to build an app that imitates my blog in React. It would have RESTful routes (new posts, new diaries) and I'd have to design some nice forms. Apart from that it would have the same CSS.</p>
        <p>It'd need auth as I would have to prevent everyone but me from accessing the POST pages.</p>
