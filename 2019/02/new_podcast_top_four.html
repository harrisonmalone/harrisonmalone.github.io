        <h2>New Podcast Top Four</h2>
        <div class='dateline'>23 February 2019</div>
        <p>This was an idea I had earlier in the week for a podcast. It's inspired by Marco and Tiffany Arment's <a href="https://www.relay.fm/topfour">Top Four</a> podcast. In fact, it's literally a clone.</p>
        <p>The podcast is a simple concept. Think of a topic you can rank in ascending order (with honorable mentions), take some notes and then talk about it. I would start with topics like top 4 best albums, movies, afl players etc.</p>
        <p>I'd want to aim for 30 mins, both for brevity in terms of not having to plan for huge hours during the week as well as creating an easy to digest show for my listeners. It would also try to be inclusive for any guest to jump in; but the focus is primarily on quality over quantity. I would try and do one podcast a month.</p>
        <p>There would be some logistical challenges. Firstly, I would want to invest in another mic. Should I do this myself? I definitely have a space now for the recording to take place; a meeting room at work would suffice. I could even book this out in advance.</p>
        <p>I could do more obscure topics as well; an example of this could be top 4 assignments at coder academy where I'd get some of the students involved.</p>
