<p>Since the birth of Siri I’ve been fascinated by voice assistants. How do they make our lives better? What can they do to improve our productivity? These are things that I’ve wanted to know but still don’t really have an answer for.</p>

<p>Siri on iOS 11 was meant to get a lot better. I think she has gotten slightly better but there are still so many improvements to be made. I judge this based on empirical evidence; before iOS 11 I didn’t use Siri every day whereas now I do.</p>

<p>There are two tasks that I do instinctually (100% chance) through voice that being setting timers and getting the weather. I’ll ask Siri to do this for me constantly.</p>

<p>There are a few more things that I use voice for sometimes (50% chance) that being getting sports scores, how to spell a word, finding synonyms, math and asking general questions. I’ll use Siri for each of these tasks at least once a week.</p>

<p>And then there are many things that I barely use voice for (10% chance) but I’m trying to utilise more often like texting, playing music or podcasts, setting reminders, translation and maps.</p>

<h4>Method</h4>

<p>The purpose of this piece today is to test Siri out. By no means is this a scientific test. I’ll give her a few simple prompts and provide some feedback on the value she offers me. Google assistant is arguably the gold standard voice assistant especially if you’re fully invested in Google’s ecosystem, so I’ll use it for some comparison.</p>

<p>So the structure of this article is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask Siri a question</li>
<li>Screenshot of the conversation</li>
<li>Emoji grading of the UX and some feedback in areas where Siri perhaps could improve</li>
</ol>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>I’ll start with the easy ones that I use routinely and work down towards the more completed queries.</p>

<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri what’s the weather today?</p>

<p style="font-size: 30px">🤩</p>

<div style="margin:20px 21px 16px;">

<img id="picstyle" src="../img/weather.png" alt="weather">

</div>

<p>The iOS 11 update seems to have improved the detail to which Siri goes with the weather. Awesome way to work out what you should wear in the morning if you have to go outdoors on your commute to work.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri set a timer for half an hour.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😁</p>

<p>If you’re cooking something or need to study for a specific period this is the fastest way to keep track of time.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri what are the scores in the NBA.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😬</p>

<div style="margin:20px 21px 16px;">

<img id="picstyle" src="../img/nba.png" alt="nba">

</div>

<p>There is room for improvement with this query but all in all it’s not terrible. I asked Siri what were the scores and she returned with what games are coming up today. This is because my question is semi wrong (there are no scores yet for today as the first game starts in 2 hours) but I didn’t ask for this. The dilemma here is should Siri give you a response based on your question even if the answer doesn’t directly solve what you’re asking. Maybe.</p>

<p>I think in this situation Siri should be able to say I can give you “scores from yesterday” or “the schedule for today”. That way you are still making the choice for a final answer.</p>

<p>Siri automatically dictates all the information she displays which can be helpful but also a bit annoying. Sometimes I just want to read it and not have her dictate. Again this should be an option for the user to decide.</p>

<p>Some other caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like that Siri understands what the final point differentiation is, for instance the Rockets beat the Pacers by 23 yesterday and Siri said that Rockets won “soundly”, on the flip side the Celtics only just beat the Raptors and she said that “the Raptors lost a close one”</li>
<li>Siri pronounces Celtics wrong</li>
<li>You can’t tap on a game to see box score stats or highlights, this would be a great feature</li>
</ul>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri spell humorous for me.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😊</p>

<div style="margin:20px 21px 16px;">

<img id="picstyle" src="../img/humorous.png" alt="humorous">

</div>

<p>Yes I suck at spelling. I was going to say above that “Siri pronounces Celtics wrong and I find that humorous” but I couldn’t spell humorous correctly. I should have asked Siri initially how to spell it and all would have been okay with the world. I know that now.</p>

<p>Like most things with Siri this isn’t going to work that great in a co-working space, a small office or a library but it works fucking amazing when you’re home alone.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri what’s a synonym for humorous.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">🧐</p>

<p>I asked Siri what the synonym for humorous is and she screwed up. She gave me web results when I just want a straight answer. However, if you ask her to define humorous there are some synonyms in those results like “comic” which you could make into “comical” and get the same meaning. Not a perfect solution though.</p>

<p>If you ask her what a synonym is for some words she will give you an answer like “great” for example.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">What’s 20 + 50 − 5 ｘ 4?</p>


<p style="font-size: 30px">😎</p>

<div style="margin:20px 21px 16px;">

<img id="picstyle" src="../img/math.png" alt="math">

</div>

<p>Worked perfectly for this equation. Siri is also really great at working out percentages of things say for example 25% of 257. Also converting fractions to percentages like 1/7 = 14.29%.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri who invented electricity?</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">🤦‍</p>

<p>Crap here. I don’t want to go to the web I want to know straight up who invented electricity. This is the prime example of where the Google assistant has a gigantic lead. Of course this is obvious because they control the majority of search. But it’s annoying as a Siri supporter. I tried another one (who invented the Internet) which she got correct so it’s kind of a hit and miss. I feel like the Google assistant has like a 95% hit rate whereas Siri is somewhere around 50%.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri send a text message.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😝</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of it it’s awesome but otherwise kind of no point to it. It’s especially handy when you’re driving but because my phone isn’t in a holder it can find it hard to recognise my voice from the middle compartment of my interior. The 6s mic just isn’t as good as what’s in the newer iPhones. You can also use Siri to read new messages which I like.</p>

<p>The thing about all of this is that it’s definitely safer and maybe even more time efficient to pull over, send/read a text message in the normal manner and then carry on driving.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri play podcasts.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😏</p>

<p>So I listen to a lot of podcasts especially whilst I’m walking the dog. I want to use Siri to control everything podcasts wise without getting my phone out of my pocket. You can play, pause and change the volume fine but what frustrates me is that you can’t pick episodes. You should be able to listen to John Gruber (The Talk Show) and then when you get sick of him change over to the Bill Simmons podcast just by saying these names.</p>

<p>Another weird Siri podcast thing is that when an episode ends you have to ask Siri to play podcasts again for a new podcast to start. Why not just play automatically? However, I think the overall podcasts app is a shit show right now so maybe Siri isn’t to blame. The day I switch to Pocket Casts is edging closer.</p>

<p>In saying all of this Siri works great with Apple music. No complaints there. An example of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a lot of trouble pronouncing difficult album titles (like Tame Impala’s InnerSpeaker) due to my Australian accent</li>
<li>I love this album so I want my voice assistants to be able to play it</li>
<li>I had access to an Amazon Echo when I was living in America and she could never get this album to play when I asked</li>
<li>Whereas with Apple music and Siri I just say “Hey Siri play Tame Impala’s first album” and she works like a charm</li>
</ul>


<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri remind me to send an email to Bill in an hour.</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">😪</p>

<p>Now in the past year or so I’ve used Google Inbox’s built in reminders to remind me of stuff. It works pretty well especially on iOS. The issue with it is the notifications. For some reason (probably caused by Apple) when you get the notification to complete the reminder at a certain time you don’t get a badge app icon. I need that badge app icon to remind me to do my shit every time I see my home screen because if it’s just a show on lock screen notification I’ll see it once and forget about it.</p>

<p>Consequently, I’m now using Siri and Apple’s reminder app to remind myself of stuff. The notifications work great. However, because I don’t use Apple calendar I don’t have reminders and events in the same place. Annoying. There probably is a work around for this but I bet it won’t be a simple fix.</p>



<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">How do you say goodbye in Portuguese?</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">🤢</p>

<p>You can’t translate in Australian English! What the hell Apple! I asked the Google assistant the same questions and she handled it fine. If I was translating something more complicated I’d use the amazing Google Translate app anyway. Apple takes a big L here. I’m pretty sure at WWDC translation was like a big selling point of iOS 11.</p>


<p id="quote" style="font-style: italic; padding: 4px 20px;">Hey Siri give me public transport directions to Flinders street station?</p>



<p style="font-size: 30px">🤬</p>

<p>Apple maps has long been a hot mess. The only reason why I have it installed is because I sometimes like to click on the geotag of Instagram pics (I’m a weirdo) to see where my friends are in the world.</p>

<p>So in this example above I asked Siri to get me public transport directions (a trickier question) from my location to Flinders Street Station and she never game them. She’d still be loading now if I hadn’t of closed the app. Conversely, the Google assistant comfortably handled this request.</p>

<p>As for driving directions Siri did fine at loading up a route to Southland but I just don’t trust Apple maps.</p>
