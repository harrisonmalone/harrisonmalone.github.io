        <p>For the HTML and CSS part of the course they do a getting to know me docs challenge. They write down how to help when feeling challenged and what might be the triggers for certain things that might make it harder for you to learn.</p>
        <p>Students can design it in any way they like; but a nice example would be something like the way <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/?t=8">GitBook</a> does it.</p>
        <p>Learn how to display text nicely on a page first. The fundamentals of things like margin and just displaying as block. Could also emphasize using HTML 5 elements.</p>
        <p>Another interesting takeaway was the mob programming they do. By the sounds of it they get set a challenge, one person is up front on the computer and can't talk while the rest of the room guides that person through the challenge. This could be a nice change up from the traditional lecture style.</p>
