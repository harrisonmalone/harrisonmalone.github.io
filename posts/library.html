        <h2>Library</h2>
        <h4>11 November 2018</h4>
        <p>My blog directory will now contain links to different resources that I need to keep as a list. I came to the conclusion that all of my posts need to be stored in one place for simplicity. That way the dates and li links can be handled in a slightly better manner with everything being in the same place.</p>
        
        <p>As for photos, they will now form individual blog posts that use the dropbox dl.dropboxusercontent.com url to automatically take you to the full width image page rather than dropbox's standard display page. These photo blog posts (or stories) need to be limited to around 20 photos each, or around the best 20 photos from a shoot.</p>

        <p>Random photos, like this mornings <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/harrisonnmalone/status/1061397486231674880">Till slow motion</a>, can be stored on my diary root page. For old photos or big trips (American photos) this obviously doesn't work and needs to have its own page dedicated to it.</p>

        <p>For my lists let's space them out over different days and when you have the time to focus on one item in particular. That way I won't have four different posts on the same day. I might do some of the photos items this morning to get a start on that.</p>

        <p>For my blog posts I like having this very minimal feel of title and then words and hrefs. No messing about with other headings or ul tags. Just simple clean writing that's easy to maintain.</p>
