        <p>No more blog page that displays all my posts. It's too hard to manage. I'll now just have a posts directory that stores all my posts, but these are only referenced on the index.html page.</p>
        
        <p>As for photos, they will now form individual blog posts that use the dropbox dl.dropboxusercontent.com url to automatically take you to the full width image page rather than dropbox's standard display page. These photo blog posts (or stories) need to be limited to around 20 photos each, or around the best 20 photos from a shoot.</p>

        <p>Random photos, like this mornings <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/harrisonnmalone/status/1061397486231674880">Till slow motion</a>, can be stored on the index page. For old photos or big trips (American photos) this obviously doesn't work and needs to have its own page dedicated photos post page.</p>

        <p>For my blog posts I like having this very minimal feel of title and then words and hrefs. No messing about with other headings or ul tags. Just simple clean writing that's easy to maintain.</p>

        <p>The clutter is now gone. It's really obvious as to where everything should reside.</p>
