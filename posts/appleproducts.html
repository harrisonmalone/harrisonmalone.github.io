<p>My iPhone 6s had a battery replacement. This was a huge win in terms of the usage I&#8217;m getting out of the phone. Even when I make errors such as last night (I forgot to put it on charge) I still have 31% the following morning for the train ride in. This simply wouldn&#8217;t have happened with the old battery (it would be dead) and that's almost worth the $75 replacement fee alone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to start using the iPad more as a musical instrument through a bluetooth keyboard. <a href="https://www.cme-pro.com/xkey-air/">This one</a> from CME would be pretty sweet. My random product idea from Apple would be to make this exact keyboard but with literally no latency. I think that they would able to achieve this with the use of the W2 chip that&#8217;s in the AirPods. I&#8217;m still getting great usage out of the iPad as a get home and chill with it device. It&#8217;s just a perfect size and weight to carry with me around the house and use kind of like a portable wireless speaker (the built in speakers are excellent). One thing that could do with a replacement is the keyboard but it&#8217;s still going along okay; just a bit buggy sometimes with the cmd key being stuck on. I&#8217;m not sure if this issue is hardware or software though.</p>

<p>One other use case for an iPad I thought of last night would be to use it as a photo editing device. It would be fun to play around with and learn how an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8">Darkroom</a> works.</p>

<p>I need a new Mac. Still not entirely sold on whether to go Pro or Air but my affinity for the Air can&#8217;t be undersold. The Air changed my life and it&#8217;s still a brilliant computer 6 years since I received it for Christmas. This machine is purely for work as everything that I currently do at home is done with the iPad. The iPad is my home and do fun stuff with device. The Mac is my work machine to write code on. </p>
