          <h2>On Why I’ll Buy AirPods</h2>
          <div class="dateline">9 January 2018</div>
          <p>I’m a slave to Apple. I have an MacBook Air, an iPad and an iPhone and there’s no turning back. I know that and I’m okay with it.</p>

          <p>This week I’ll be making a trip to the Apple store to get my iPhone screen fixed. Its been cracked for about 6 months and my patience is wearing thin. I keep putting it off citing the fact I have no job with a steady income stream but it’s just one of those things I need to do.</p>
          
          <p>Whilst I’m there I’m probably going to give in to the temptation of buying AirPods. Yes, they got heaps of flak out of the gate because they looked super weird; like cotton buds shoved in your ears. And they’re also pricey being just a tad over the $200 mark.</p>
          
          <p>But these days I see more and more people rocking them in public. Two of my best mates have AirPods and they love them. I also read lots of tweets that are along the lines of “Airpods are the best tech purchase I’ve made all year”. It has definitely become socially acceptable to own them.</p>
          
          <p>Again I reiterate that I have really limited funds so I need to talk myself into buying them. Why do I need them and why will they make my life better?</p>
          
          <p>Well firstly I’m someone who listens to a shitload of podcasts. Like I listen to more content these days than I read. There are many situations where AirPods will help make my podcast obsession much easier to live with. </p>
          
          <p>One example is breakfast time. I love waking up in the morning with a cup of coffee, a bowl of cereal and a sports (or tech) podcast being beamed directly into my brain. I’ll have my old headphones in as to not disturb my mum and my brother who are around me probably watching some shitty morning television show. </p>
          
          <p>But the cord from these headphones gets in the way of my eating and drinking. It gets in the way of my mouth as I try to swallow my delicious cereal. I hate that. </p>
          
          <p>I also hate it when my mum asks me something and I have to take one of my headphones out; only to not really comprehend what she’s saying because I still have one headphone in and my hearing sucks. I eventually just give up, pause the podcast and take both headphones out. </p>
          
          <p>With AirPods, when you take one pod out the audio you’re listening to immediately pauses if you want it to. Great for me. </p>
          
          <p>Another positive situation for AirPods would be in the car. I have no aux connection which absolutely sucks so I generally rely on the radio or CDs for listening to stuff whilst driving. I could start using my AirPods in the car which grants me more time with my favourite podcasts and music. Not great when you have someone in the car with you but I’m mostly alone so we’re all sweet. </p>
          
          <p>Yes I could use my normal headphones for this car task but there are some things that AirPods excel at namely its automatic ear detection and no cord so you can leave your iPhone anywhere in the car. Sometimes I don’t want my phone to be sitting in my lap or being annoying in my pocket. I want to place it wherever is comfortable and still get great audio. </p>
          
          <p>The quick pairing and Siri functionality is great I’ve heard. My mates swear to me that they’ve had no issues with the audio dropping out or anything like that. I’ve never owned a perfect bluetooth audio device so I'll always be a skeptic until I get something that doesn’t drop out or do weird shit. </p>
          
          <p>The battery is also apparently fantastic. Again going off what my mates tell me, you charge the battery case for a couple of hours and you’re good for a week plus. The actual pods charge in the case so you just need to worry about plugging that in every now and then. Having one of those wireless charging pads will make this job even easier.
          </p>
          
          <p>One last thing I think is cool is the left right settings options. When you double tap on the left or right pod you can tell it to do certain things. The options are basic (pause, stop, Siri, next/previous track) but I like the fact that you can program this. </p>
          
          <p>So will I buy AirPods? It's a resounding yes.</p>
