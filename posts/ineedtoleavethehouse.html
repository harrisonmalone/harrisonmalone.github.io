<p>Stress, anxiety, depression. These are all state of minds I’ve been going through for a couple of months. I’m not depressed, not that bad anyway, but I have been going through some pretty dark shit. I’ve just generally been a grumpy asshole to be around.</p>

<p>This was a caused by a few things. For one, I don’t know where I’m going professionally. I guess I figured out some of this last week in terms of going back to basics and keeping things simple. Focusing on my mental health.</p>

<p>Simple thing number one: I decided that I need a job; any job within limits. I need to get out of the house and do shit for money. Not sit at home applying for work I’m just not qualified to do and trying to make videos that get no views.</p>

<p>That was an experiment and it failed really badly. </p>

<p>Simple thing number two: I need to write a column like this a couple of times a week and do a sports podcast. Both of these things make me happy and allow me to grow creatively. </p>

<p>Do they make me more employable? Kinda... but not really. I could try to freelance some of this out but then again I really don’t think my writing is of that high quality. </p>

<p>I do at least now have a home for everything at <a href="http://www.harrisonmalone.info">harrisonmalone.info</a> which makes sharing my content far easier. </p>

<p>Speaking of leaving the house, my writing comes out more freely when I’m in a public space. I might not be any better but I’m definitely faster and less pedantic. </p>

<h4>So why might this be the case?</h4>

<p>Well I think the environment of a cafe or a coworking space (which are bloody <a href="http://www.theworkery.com.au/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzLfAgfjb2AIVxDUrCh3W5wh2EAAYAyAAEgIGtPD_BwE">expensive</a> in Melbourne) make you feel more like you’re doing real work. Home is where you feel comfortable. Where you wind down not up. At home you have all these things around you to waste time on. A guitar to pick up and strum. Gaming consoles. A dog.</p>

<p>Heading to a cafe also gets you going earlier in the morning. You have to wake up and actually go somewhere. I enjoy the early morning bike ride to get to work. It wakes me up and gets the blood pumping. </p>

<p>You also have some ambient noise around you which I quite like. The grinding of beans, the whooshing of milk and some kind of instrumental soundtrack. There’s also other customers ordering their coffees and talking about their lives to the barista. It all gets my mind ticking over and typing faster. </p>

<p>Like I said before, home is comfortable. My office chair at home I think is too comfortable. It makes me too relaxed. At a cafe I’m usually on a shittier chair that isn’t as comfy. The faster I work the faster I can leave and sit on the comfy chair and do relaxing things. </p>

<p>At the cafe you’re also bound to have shittier wifi. Shittier wifi means you’ll be procrastinating less on the internet. Less social media browsing and YouTube watching. </p>

<p>Shower thought: whilst fast wifi is great for some things shittier wifi is actually better for writers. You get sick of having to wait too long for the next article to load. You might as well be writing yourself. </p>

<p>Lastly, working from home is really lonely. I neglected a few things when I was going through some that shit I mentioned but my biggest error was not talking to people enough. I’ve been making more of a conscious effort to reach out to my mates over the past few weeks but also being out of provides the opportunity to talk to strangers. The barista or the old lady that needs help opening the cafe door. </p>

<p>Today I applied for a lot of work so I’m hoping something comes out of it. I need some cash flow ASAP and then I can focus on the other part of my professional life and that is learning more code/development stuff. </p>
