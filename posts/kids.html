        <h2>Kids</h2>
        <h4>November 11 2018</h4>
        <p>I love looking at photos when me and Jake were kids. It's kind of relaxing and it makes me very nostalgic. I used the Google photo scanner to scan these photos and then uploaded them to dropbox.</p>

        <p>This is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p5rp2h76b2201zr/ruby_pup.jpg?dl=0">when Ruby was a pup</a>. I love looking at the old Stradbroke Avenue especially the colour of the couch and the VCRs in the background. There is also this photo of the  <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ifvahvkk6syu7us/old_house_becs_dogs.jpg?dl=0">house pre renovation</a> with the old floors and my aunties dogs inside, which was a rarity at that time (dogs being inside).</p>

        <p>Speaking of cute photo's of Jake when he was a baby there is an abundance, like the one of him <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/azjfcxsocf6jdks/jake_eating_chicken_bone.jpg?dl=0">eating a chicken bone</a> or <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f4nt9kv97unxuh2/jake_in_favourite_jumper.jpg?dl=0">wearing his favorite orange Kathmandu jumper</a>.</p>

        <p>There are two photo's that I love of the days that me and Jake were born. No idea who took them but they did a great job. The first is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/dk4s8625jm0n36s/when_i_was_born.jpg?dl=0">me with my proud parents</a>, also with my aunty and pop hovering the background with their very 90's clothes on. Then there is a family shot of the day Jake was born. This is perhaps my all time favorite childhood photo and one of the only photos <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/o5kcyhu56jinm0m/when_jake_was_born.jpg?dl=0">with all of us together as a family</a>.</p>

        <p>A big bulk of photos were taken on Jake's first birthday whilst we still lived in Mentone such as <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/yg583rjldy29r9v/mentone.jpg?dl=0">this</a>, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3umvxu651wto2dx/jakes_first_birthday.jpg?dl=0">this</a> and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ln8gaefqqhitime/pop.jpg?dl=0">this one</a>. The latter of which is a great one becuase it really captures the spirit of my pop.</p>

        <p>As a kid I was lucky enough to go on a few great holidays. When I was around 6, my extended family (cousins) went on a trip to the outback, driving to Adelaide then through the Flinders Ranges and right up to Cameron's Corner (border of NSW, QLD and SA). This photo <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/clcuczhkvfdhu9y/desert_trip_four_wheel_drive.jpg?dl=0">sitting on the front of a 4-wheel-drive</a> is a classic and shows how little we all were. Don't know how our parents managed to stay sane with 5 toddlers going crazy. There is also a nice family shot on the same holiday.</p>

        <p>I can vaguely remember the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bnzhg7hhp0uybsk/first_snow_trip.jpg?dl=0">first time I saw snow</a> and went skiing down a mountain at dangerous speeds. I especially love Jake's face in it.</p>

        <p>A few more cute photo's that I'll chuck into this post are <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wjpcfs7t899tn0v/raincoats.jpg?dl=0">me and Jake wearing raincoats and pulling funny faces</a>, a shot with <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0lq71wkr9rpebs2/vampires.jpg?dl=0">me wearing a Vampires footy jumper</a>, me and Jake about to go to a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0q2q3gc7gih2cec/me_and_jake_in_corduroy.jpg?dl=0">music concert in our best corduroy jackets</a> and a classic photo of us on the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tklnbbq3hool6gg/morning_playstation.jpg?dl=0">PlayStation 2 in matching pajamas</a>.</p>

        <p>There's way more photo's of us as kids that I'll keep incrementally putting up in the future. At least for now I'm happy with the structure of these posts.</p>
