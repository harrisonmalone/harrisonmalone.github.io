          <h2>On Twitter Doubling Its Character Limit to 280</h2>
          <div class="dateline">9 November 2017</div>
          <p>People who know me would say that for a long time I’ve been a big believer in Twitter. I was a user back in 2012, when many of my mates in Australia had profiles and we all went hashtag crazy and posted stupid things when we were out.</p>

          <p>Then most of my friends left Twitter in 2013 but I stayed on. I loved the interface and the fact that it was text first and other media second. I loved the openness of it, the fact that you could follow any person and not have to worry about them accepting you. It was great for my profession too. Our media lecturers stressed that we should be using Twitter to reach out to people to grow our brands. I didn’t fully take this on board until recently.</p>
          
          <p>So I love Twitter despite the fact that only a small portion of my close friends and colleagues actually use it here in Australia. For full disclosure, this is for people around their mid twenties.</p>
          
          <p>When I went to America it was a totally different story. Many of the people I met whom were in their mid twenties heavily used Twitter. And they use it to communicate within their friendship circle which is something I wish I could do. I wish the people who I keep in contact with on Facebook shifted across to Twitter. It would save me a lot of time.</p>
                    
          <p>So anyway I love Twitter and I care about it’s success. I want it to succeed and grow into something better. I really enjoyed their recent UI refresh with the swipe right or left navigation.</p>
          
          <p>But the recent doubling of the character limit up to 280 for tweets is a game changer in many ways. It’s a big ballsy move from Twitter and something that will frustrate many users who see it as kind of a silly thing to implement when there are heaps of other things that should be done first. I’ll get to those later.</p>
          
          <p>For now I want to focus on the 280 and what it means. Let’s look at Twitters logic first. They say that 9% of all tweets in english hit the 140 character limit. That is a huge number when you consider there are 500 million tweets sent out everyday.</p>
          
          <p>For me hitting the limit was kind of annoying. I might have had to delete a couple of words out or rework what I was trying to say. But this wasn’t ever really a terrible thing. Brevity is a goal that all writing should strive towards and Twitter enabled that with the 140 limit.</p>
          
          <p>So what might be some other reasons behind Twitter’s character doubling? What are some other pros of 280? I thought of some stuff.</p>
          
          <p>Firstly, with 280 they’ll be less thread posting. I’m guilty of posting threads myself when I should have just put everything in one tweet. The problem with thread posts is to do with how threads show up on the timeline. If you do a thread post longer that two tweets, the rest of the thread is hidden behind a show more link. You don’t want this show more link. You want users to be able to read your content on their timeline. So theatrically users now have 460 characters of space to work with and thats awesome for getting lots of your content on your followers timelines.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and a positive in my opinion, is that they’ll be less screenshot posting of note apps or quotes. This was a common way of how users got around the 140 limit. I have no problem with doing these screenshots but I think from a UX perspective it’s better to have more normal text posts and less photo quote or notes posts.
          The third positive I can see for 280 is simply that you can be way more eloquent now. Yes, brevity is great but sometimes there are long words that add a lot of character to the message you’re trying to get across. These words won’t be as excluded from tweets anymore.</p>
          <p>And the last thing that comes to mind is when you are trying to @ someone new it’ll be easier now to get your point across with 280. I often @ users I’ve just followed and want them to follow me back. With 280 I won’t have to do the classic @ and then “can I send you a DM.” I’ll most likely 
                    
          <p>The positives are great and all but what people are really talking about right now is the negative side of the 280 argument. For starters:</p>
          
          <p>I think the biggest problem is that users have to kind of re-wire and train their brains to even bother with reading 280 tweets. Twitter users are so ingrained with the idea of reading a maximum of 140 characters and then scrolling to the next thing. 140 was such a definitive feature and it will take some getting used to. My belief is that users will be inclined to look at a 280 tweet in their timeline and their brain will tell them to tune out.</p>
          <p>People are just taking the piss right now and purposely tweeting silly 280 character tweets. This will go away but it’s still annoying.</p>
          <p>The circle icon is just a stupid way to record the character count. Just go back to the original way please Twitter.</p>
          
          <p>What I think engenders the most hate for Twitter is not so much implementing specific features. I actually think features like moments (which I know a lot of users hate) has some utility and is a useful way for me to learn about today’s news. 280 will be like this. It will be seen as a stupid product feature in the short term but in the long term it will be embraced.</p>
          
          <p>But what really causes the hate is the fact that Twitter continually ignores its users. It knows that we want them to sort out harassment, provide the ability to edit tweets and reintroduce a chronological timeline. But it fails to listen. And it has failed for a very very long time. I love Twitter but if they really listened to their users they would be in a better position of growth right now. Those friends that I mentioned earlier who left might come back.</p>
