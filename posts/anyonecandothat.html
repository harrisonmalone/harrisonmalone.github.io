          <h2>Anyone Can Do That</h2>
          <div class="dateline">27 February 2018</div>
          <p>It happened in the first few year when I was doing my <a href="https://coursesearch.unimelb.edu.au/undergrad/1500-bachelor-of-arts" target="_blank"> Arts degree</a>. This feeling that I’m doing something that I don’t really care about. This idea in my head that what I’m doing isn’t making me happy. This gut feeling of insecurity and anxiousness that has never left me even up to now. </p>

          <p>I think I’ve figured out why I felt this way and it might come out a little self-centred. I did a degree learning skills that everyone can already do. I can write  (kind of) and research (Google). I can be creative on social media. I can follow a brief. But when it comes down to it; you give these tasks to anyone out there with a high school education and for the most part they can do these tasks at a level similar to me or better. </p>
          
          <p>With these skills I can’t differentiate myself from the pack. I don’t have anything to show for myself. To say to people - look what I made or built - like my brother can when he casually says I helped build this house. </p>
          
          <p>Then you have another problem (related to writing mostly) in that there is so much free content out there. I learnt how to make good content (like I said above) but for the most part it’s done for free because anyone can do it. Any old schmuck can think up a good blog or social media post with little effort.  </p>
          
          <p>I want to be able to do things that other people can’t do. Take running for example; I’m willing to bet that I’m in the top 5% of people who go for runs in Australia. Put me in a race from any distance between 400 metres and 20 kilometers and more likely than not I’ll beat the majority of people I’m racing.   </p>
          
          <p>I like this feeling of winning and coming out on top. Running past people out of breath and struggling to finish their workout whilst I’m just cruising along, picking them off one by one. </p>
          
          <p>I win because I’ve out worked everyone else. I’ve run almost everyday for 15 years. This is why I want to code. </p>
          
          <p>You can’t hand someone a computer with no experience and say make this website or app. They wouldn’t know where to start. Conversely, you can hand the majority of people a pen and paper and say write about this topic and they can do it. </p>
          
          <p>I want to be better than the average person. Like the running example, it makes me happy when I’m not just average. When I’m doing things different. I want to be different and do something no one else in my family or school friendship group does.     </p>
