        <h2>Reading Management</h2>
        <div class="dateline">December 24 2018</div>
        <p>Bookmarking links and figuring out what is the most quality use of my time in terms of reading has long been an interesting conundrum to me. I've <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/posts/rss">written about it before</a> and more or less follow that system I talked about a year ago.</p>
        <p>However, there are some changes to this system and I'd like to go into a little more detail about the apps I'm using. This guide was also inspired by a <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/harrisonnmalone/status/1075659085981184000">discussion I had on Twitter</a> a few days ago around personal blogging and social media. The year long backlash (techlash) against Facebook has led to a strong chorus of folks calling for you to delete your Facebook account. But what do we replace it with? And by extension, how do we find things to read online?</p>
        <p>I like to keep things simple. I like being recommended some sort of article about a topic I'm interested in (sport, tech) and then reading it with minimal advertising and distraction.</p>
        <p>Everything starts with Twitter for me. I spend probably a little too much time on the platform but it's so just such a nice way to find information in my areas of interest. If someone I follow and trust has linked an article it's probably going to be good. It's simple word of mouth.</p>
        <p>This isn't enough though. What if it's a long read and I simply don't have the time to get through the whole piece. This is where bookmarks come in. I use <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> which is perhaps the most simple yet elegant bookmarking service around. It has an <a href="https://pinboard.in/api/">API</a> and as such there are heaps of different native apps that work beautifully with my different devices. I'm a iOS guy (iPad, iPhone) and do a tonne of reading on the iPad so having a nice bookmarking app on it is important to me.</p>
        <p>I'm currently using <a href="http://pinnerapp.net/">Pinner</a> which adheres to the standards I'm looking for. The design is clean and it doesn't feel out of place on iOS, it has as an option to add a new bookmark from the share sheet, it enables quick and easy editing of things like titles and supports Safari's show reader view which gets rid of obtrusive ads.</p>
        <p>I like keeping all of my bookmarks uniform and make sure all titles are lower case, so the editing feature is very important to me (when you add a bookmark from the share sheet it's usually all uppercase automatically). This is weird I know; I think I do this because I love the structure of programming languages that have a case convention.</p>
        <p>Twitter is great and I find lot's of good things there but what if I don't want to spend as much time on Twitter. This is a problem that RSS solves. The <a href="https://harrisonmalone.com/posts/rss">article</a> I wrote last year goes into more detail about RSS but to cut to the chase, I still believe that RSS is a very underutilized technology. Maybe because it tends to be a little finicky to get it up and running? To actually add things to a feed and then how to manage the clutter is not easy.</p>
        <p>I think I understand RSS because I've used podcasting clients (my favorite is <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>) for quite a while.</p>
        <p>I have a select few writers that when they post something new I want it straight away. This includes <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@mgsiegler">M.G. Siegler</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a>. I want immediate access to the linksto their articles.</p>
        <p>Now I could use some sort of RSS reader to do this job. But that requires me getting a new app that I'd then have to manage. I don't want to do that. I want to use something that exists on all my devices. Something that I already manage. The answer is email. The humble email.</p>
        <p>The service that connects RSS to email for me is <a href="http://blogtrottr.com/">Blogtrottr</a>. It provides a service that simply works; by no means is it elegant (the web app is trash) but when you understand what the limitations are you're good to go. I get a daily digest email if any of my RSS subscriptions are updated; if I don't have time to read the content at that exact moment I'll chuck the link into Pinboard.</p>
        <p>Blogtrottr isn't just for traditional media. It can also be used for say a YouTube channel (get an email everytime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee">Marques Brownlee</a> posts a new video) or Twitter account. This is the flexibility of RSS. This is why open standards like RSS are always better at the end of the day for the customer.</p>
        <p>Finally I get things to read through email subscriptions. For just over a year now I've been a happy customer of <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au/">The Sizzle</a> where I get the latest in tech news (from an Aussies perspective) as well as some more obscure stuff (like this <a href="http://www.maccaps.com/MacCaps/DIY_Information_files/Macintosh_Manual_1984.pdf">1984 Macintosh manual</a> that was posted about a week ago). It's refreshing to have tech news written by an Aussie as most of what's online can be way too America centric. I also look forward to to receiving the <a href="https://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a> every Saturday morning as this always has an array of the best tech content of the week. I highly recommend it!</p>
        <p>Not all of what I've mentioned above is free but it's hopefully very affordable for most. I pay $11 a year for Pinboard which I think is a brilliant deal. Pinboard is a service I'll continue using for the long term. I pay Blogtrotter $5 a month for their Lite plan. As I said above, it has some flaws but it works for me.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to include (build) a few things into this reading system in the future. I still lack a great macOS experience for Pinboard. I tried <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spillo/id873245660">Spillo</a> but it just wasn't for me. I'm thinking of trying to build something from scratch using the Pinboard API and <a href="https://electronjs.org/">React</a>. It might also be a nice way to learn how to use <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> so I can have a native Mac app instead of something just on the web. I'm also still not really satisfied with Blogtrotter. I think I could build an RSS to email service myself (maybe using <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html">Active Mailer</a> but I'd need some guidance on where to start). The frustration is really based on the crappy Blogtrotter web app; the back-end part is rock solid.</p>
