            <h2>The Music Streaming Wars</h2>
            <h4>22 November 2017</h4>
            <p>I‚Äôm a weirdo when it comes to music. I can remember getting kind of bullied in the early days of high school because someone was listening to my iPod Mini (you totes shared that device around) and they found Delta Goodrem and Robbie Williams songs on there. No offence to those artists I think they‚Äôre fine but maybe it‚Äôs not the type of music you want to be listening to if you want an in with the cool kids.</p>

            <p>From that point on I resolved to have ‚Äúgood‚Äù music taste. I use quotation marks because I pass no judgement against people who purely listen to number one pop hits on commercial radio stations. If music makes you happy that‚Äôs all that matters.</p>

            <p>But having this ‚Äúgood‚Äù music taste became like an obsession for me to prove the haters wrong. I researched music, learnt about the history of different genres that my mum and dad never introduced me to and downloaded a lot of stuff using LimeWire.</p>

            <p>I was such a hacker ü§™.</p>

            <p>Over the years my iTunes library became like this sacred holy grail of music organisation. For starters, I only had albums in my iTunes; no random singles floating around. I also had all my genres, album covers and years the album was released exactly correct. I didn‚Äôt screw around.</p>

            <p>I organised everything in this way as I liked the way it looked (especially with all my albums sorted by year) and it was maybe a way for me to express my pent up obsessive compulsion.</p>

            <p>About a month ago, I came to the sad conclusion that it was time to say bye bye to iTunes because a) my beloved iPod classic has a cooked battery b) I needed the spare disk space on my MacBook Air and c) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q37xJtuQ24w" target="_blank">quoting Sergeant Riggs</a> but I‚Äôm too old to be downloading .rar files from some dodgy Russian website.</p>

            <p>There‚Äôs also the fact that music streaming services (well two) are really good and affordable.</p>

            <p>I didn‚Äôt just rashly delete all of my iTunes library. I made sure to put it securely in the cloud so my years of work and effort wasn‚Äôt in the trash can.
            I then had to make the big decision. Apple Music or Spotify? I usually would do at least like an hour of research to really come to a conclusive reason on what to pick but I had my mind made up.</p>

            <p>It was Ô£ø. I went into the Apple Music app and clicked start free trial.</p>

            <p>For some background on why I picked Apple Music, I need to disclose that I‚Äôve used Spotify as a free user over the past 2 years or so. I enjoyed it. It‚Äôs a great app with a great user experience.</p>

            <p>I put up with the ads. I didn‚Äôt mind that I couldn‚Äôt skip many songs because I normally listen to albums all the way through anyway. Interestingly, I noticed that when I got my iPad Pro that song skips work differently between iPhone and iPad. You get unlimited song skips on iPad and the web app but you only get six per hour on an iPhone.</p>

            <p>The discover weekly playlist and general algorithm wizardry of Spotify is absolutely best in class. I know of many people who use Spotify purely for this functionality but for me it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. Yeah it‚Äôs a cool feature to have an algorithm that literally knows your tastes perfectly but I like researching and reading about music. I don‚Äôt want a script to perform this task for me.</p>

            <p>I used Spotify mainly to check out new music that I didn‚Äôt want to download just yet. Pretty much if Pitchfork, Anthony Fantano or Resident Advisor recommended something I‚Äôd save the album in my library and then come back to it later.</p>

            <p>An album kind of had to prove its worth and listenability on Spotify (or the minor leagues) before it made it to iTunes (the major leagues).</p>

            <p>So yeah you could say that I was a fan of Spotify. So why did you choose Apple Music then you dummy?</p>

            <p>Apple Music has it‚Äôs flaws *cough* no web app *cough* but you can always rely on Apple to do a couple of things well.</p>

            <p>Firstly, there‚Äôs the simple reason and that is battery life. Battery life is great when you use a native Apple app on an Apple device. Music chews through a fair chuck of battery when you‚Äôre like me and still rocking an older iPhone... but I still have a headphone jack suckers üòú. Even if it‚Äôs only a tiny battery saving over Spotify, battery life matters to me and it should matter to you.</p>

            <p>Secondly, uploading albums that aren‚Äôt on Apple Music is really easy. Ironically I had to use iTunes to do this but the process was pain free. The uploaded albums appeared straight away on my iPhone and iPad and that was exactly what I wanted to see. Spotify can upload local files too but from what I can tell the process is a little clunkier.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, whilst the Apple Music user interface is arguably worse than Spotify overall (<a href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-rejected-by-apple-music-so-i-redesigned-it-b7e2e4dc64bf" target="_blank">read this</a> to see some suggested improvements) I think it works better for me. I like Apple Music‚Äôs album view better as it really showcases what I think is almost the most important part of listening to music and that is album artwork. One huge issue that I have with Apple Music album view is the sort feature. You can only sort by title and artist but Apple please let me sort by year!</p>

            <p>Fourth, there‚Äôs price. Price is exactly the same and I assume that an agreement exists between the two companies to keep it this way. In saying this, I just trust Apple more with my money‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs a bit of brand loyalty as well. I‚Äôve been with Apple all this time for music and I guess I just don‚Äôt want to let that die.</p>

            <p>Lastly, and this is related to the first point, but Apple Music is totally optimised for Apple devices. When the iPhone X came out Apple Music was good to go whereas Spotify still had design issues with the notch. Because Apple makes the hardware they will always be one step ahead in designing Apple Music for that particular piece of hardware.</p>

            <p>I won‚Äôt get billed until February but I guess once that starts happening the value of Apple Music will really come into question. Will I keep using it?</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm going to hypothesis that I will. The simplicity of Apple Music suits me and it really is providing a great experience right now. Looking at those reasons above I think it is brand loyalty that becomes the most important part of the choices I‚Äôve made. The same applies for most product choices consumers make.</p>

            <p>Or have I just been brain washed by all that Apple advertising? Probably. But let‚Äôs not dwell on that.</p>
