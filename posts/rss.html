            <h2>RSS</h2>
            <div class="dateline">5 March 2018</div>
            <p>I think good old RSS is severely underrated. In fact, I’m of the opinion that RSS is really great. I’ve only used it (in ways I’ll explain later) for around the past 6 months but it has changed the way I consume my content (videos, blog posts) that aren’t discovered via Twitter. </p>

            <p>The viability of RSS came to my attention through my own podcast and the way in which new podcasts are pushed to the podcasting app I use (<a href="https://overcast.fm" target="_blank">Overcast</a>). Setting up a podcast through RSS is such old tech and it’s a pain in the ass to figure out. However, because of its simplicity it survives and thrives even! Simplicity for me is key to any product but particularly in the content world. </p>
            
            <p>You are in total control of your content through RSS. You have a central hub and a place to go when you have time to read, listen or watch. You know something good and something useful will be there. Pre RSS, I had my content all over the shop. I had to go here, there and everywhere to access what I wanted and it was a shit way to use my time. </p>
            
            <p>I was signed up to way too many email newsletters and I had too many content apps that were just bloat. Not only were they just bloat but they also caused time wasting, procrastination and addiction (YouTube particularly). I want to be mindful of how I spend my time. I want the ways in which I get my content to be healthy. </p>
            
            <p>Now the solution here is kinda obvious. Just delete the bloat apps and unsubscribe from useless email newsletters right? </p>
            
            <p>The conundrum is that I still want content from my favourite writers and creators on the internet to be delivered to me in a timely manner, preferably as soon as they hit publish. I want this content to be in one central hub. One place that is easily accessible across devices and that notifies you when this content is sent. </p>
            
            <p>The answer: a combination of old school email and old school RSS.</p>
            
            <p>If all of my favorite content is sent to my email then it’s easily available across all my devices (I use the vanilla Apple Mail app on MacOS and iOS). Email also push notifies you. </p>
            
            <p>I use a service called <a href="https://blogtrottr.com" target="_blank">Blogtrotter</a> which allows you to enter in a creators RSS url and then you choose the time frame and frequency of notifications (immediately or daily digest). You pay $19 a year for their services (ad free) which I think is a good deal. </p>
            
            <p>Content is sent to you in a simple .txt style and it makes for clean easy reading and viewing. RSS works perfectly for services like Medium and YouTube where a lot of my favorite creators reside.  </p>
            
            <p>For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@mgsiegler" target="_blank">MG Siegler</a> who is my favourite tech writer posts everything on Medium. I used to receive a weekly Medium newsletter but really the only use I got out of it was clicking on the MG article, which by that point was probably like 4 days old. I want MG’s new posts to be sent to me straight away and I don’t want to have to rely on Twitter to see them.</p>
            
            <p>The RSS and Blogtrottr combo do just that. YouTube is a similar story with a slightly different context. I want my favourite YouTubers new videos to be sent to me straight away (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee" target="_blank">MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat" target="_blank">Casey Neistat</a>). But, I also don’t want to be goaded into something YouTube recommends to me and then end up down some rabbit hole and boom I’ve wasted 2 hours watching some fucking 14 year old vlogger.</p>
            
            <p>I want to go into YouTube and get out. Kinda like supermarket shopping. Get in, get what you need then get the fuck out.   </p>
            
            <p>For other writers like <a href="https://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> I get interesting tech articles to learn more from and tweet about. I don’t ever have to go to Daring Fireball to see whats new. I get whats new in an automated and simple way.  </p>
            
            <p>Now a caveat here is getting even more emails and just having a huge block of unread. I don’t get a barrage of emails so new content doesn’t get lost in the noise however it would if you just get too many emails. To counter this you can setup a smart folder and store all your Blogtrottr emails there. I know Google Inbox and Apple Mail do this. </p>
            
            <p>Believe me, RSS is the simple answer to your content problems. Sure it’s outdated tech but it’s also something that is ingrained into the web. Like email, we think we don’t really need it but we actually really do because it’s fucking useful.   </p>
