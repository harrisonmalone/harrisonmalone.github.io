          <h2>Notes Workflow</h2>
          <div class="dateline">22 May 2018</div>
          <p>My notes setup and workflow is something I've long been passionate about. I'm a sucker for finding the perfect workflow. The fastest, most efficient way to store my ideas and writing.</p>

          <p>I tried all the apps. It started with Microsoft OneNote for first year university. I had just gotten my first ever laptop. I was young and stupid! Then I got a bit smarter and used Evernote for a couple of years. It was okay and got me through school but I gave on it after a while. So I shifted to Google Keep. I enjoyed the way Google Keep ran as a nice web app and displayed all your notes like post its, but it lacked features. I then acquired an iPad Pro and read about how good Bear was. I gave Bear a go. It's really good but it didn't quite do it for me.</p>
          
          <p>I then had a good long hard think about what I needed and what I was missing in my notes workflow. I now believe I've now come to a solution that is simple and effective. It ticks all my boxes. So what boxes are they?</p>
          
          <p>Well for starters I have a MacBook Air, an iPad Pro and an iPhone and I wanted a simple way to store and sync all my notes across these devices. I wanted a simple way to name my notes. I also wanted a simple way to create my notes. What I realised (whilst doing a web development bootcamp) was that I needed optimal CRUD (create, read, update, delete).</p>
          
          <p>Great CRUD could not be achieved with third party note apps for the most part because it's a bit more difficult to create and delete in my opinion. It takes ages to bulk delete notes in something like Bear for example. Read and update on the other hand; they tend to be just fine.</p>
          
          <p>To get really fast creating and deleting I needed to go native. I needed to go all in on what my main work machine (Mac) does really well and that is using keyboard shortcuts. This is explained better but going through how I write a note on my Mac.</p>
          
          <p>Step one I get an idea. Step two I cmd-spacebar (spotlight) and search for TextEdit. Yep, good old textedit. Maybe the most underrated tool for doing work.</p>
          
          <p>I remember the days waiting 15 seconds for fucking Word to open. Now it's a snappy spotlight search and boom I'm typing my idea out.</p>
          
          <p>I like to save all my TextEdit notes straight to my desktop. I also have the font size relatively large as this is much better for the eyes. You can also change the size of the font so quickly (which I sometimes need to do to export as a pdf) with cmd-minus(-) or cmd-plus(+). However, in saying this, it's all just personal preferences here.</p>
          
          <p>One thing I love about TextEdit and other native Mac apps (like Mail) is the ability to use option-esc. This little known hidden feature will autocomplete hard to spell words for you once you type a few letters in.</p>
          
          <p>I mentioned before that naming notes is key to me. A good name makes a note searchable and you then don't accidentally delete it down the road. I was again inspired by my course for naming notes; I now use snake_case to name everything. As long as the note title needs to be, it will always be in clean lower snake case. Everything is then standardized and clear.</p>
          
          <p>So I have my nice snake_case notes on my desktop but I need them to be in the cloud so I can access them everywhere. I store everything in iCloud Drive; controversial I know but I've come to appreciate it's simplicity. Native is always better!</p>
          
          <p>My workflow to move notes from the desktop to iCloud is weird but it's super fast now that I'm used to it. So I cmd-c (copy), cmd-delete (delete), cmd-spacebar (spotlight search) "iCloud Drive" and then cmd-v into iCloud.</p>
          
          <p>The D part in CRUD (delete) is so easy using iCloud Drive. I really like the ability to clean up the mess every now and then. I simply cycle through all my notes with the cmd-up and down arrows and use cmd-delete to delete files.</p>
          
          <p>I forgot to mention, iCloud Drive became more useful because the iOS Files app is actually quite decent. Hopefully it gets a few updates at WWDC but all in all I'm quite happy with it.</p>
          
          <p>On my iPad I use Coda for notes (exorbitant I know but it's a really fucking good text editor). It also has a few shortcuts that I rely on cmd-n (new .txt) and cmd-s (save). I can also make the text nice and big for readability and really power through typing with the iPad magic keyboard. People hate this keyboard but man can I type fast with it.</p>
          
          <p>So I save notes here and store them into Files. Once new notes are stored in Files they are deleted in Coda. No wasted space.</p>
          
          <p>On my iPhone I've gone really old school. I literally use the stock notes app. It works; that's all I can really say about it. Random notes are exported as .txt to Files and then deleted in the Notes app. One thing Notes does do for me, and does it really well, is keeping my to do and to read lists. This applies to the iPad as well. This doesn't need to be stored in Files as it's something that is constantly changing. It would be annoying and overkill to import/export to do lists from Files every day.</p>
          
          <p>So that's my notes workflow. It's crazy I know but I really like keeping things native and using the full (and often hidden) capabilities of my Apple devices.</p>
