          <h2>Reviewing Revue</h2>
          <div class="dateline">18 January 2018</div>
          <p>I think <a href="https://www.getrevue.co" target="_blank">Revue</a> is one of the best “it just works” products I’ve seen in quite a while. For some background, Revue is an email campaign management tool. Their mission is for everyone in the world to send and receive email newsletters. </p>

          <p>I already loved the idea of email newsletters for a number of reasons.</p>

          <p>Firstly, everyone has an email address yet not everyone has the social media that you’re sharing your content on (or they have it but they aren’t engaged at all). Potentially you have even more reach than Facebook... a lot of people my age ignore Facebook now anyway in favour of Instagram where you can’t share links and that’s a problem for creators.</p>

          <p>Secondly, mail apps on phones are getting better and more people have notifications turned on for every email they receive. Think of it this way, every time you post a newsletter your subscribers are (unless they have notifications turned off) getting a push notification.  </p>

          <p>In sum, email is a great distribution channel and creators are realising this. Email is even better than social media in some cases, because you get this huge reach and accessibility. You get eyes on your content.  </p>

          <p>Now obviously the hard part is getting people to subscribe. Your content isn’t just going to randomly appear on someone’s feed after being parsed through an algorithm. It’s more of an effort to enter your email address into a form that you don’t 100% trust (people hate getting spammed) over say liking or following a publisher. </p>

          <p>Luckily, Revue makes it very easy for people (or customers) to subscribe because it’s well designed. </p>

          <p>I’ve subscribed and unsubscribed to quite a few newsletters over the last few years. I’ve even tried my hand at making a newsletter of my own on MailChimp. </p>

          <p>Now what works for me in a newsletter is simplicity and personality. You need to have simplicity in the way the newsletter is designed and it needs to be written in a personal tone that engages your subscribers. A great example of these aspects in a newsletter is <a href="https://www.thesizzle.com.au" target="_blank">The Sizzle</a> and <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profilename&utm_medium=email&utm_source=The+Interface" target="_blank">The Interface</a>.</p>

          <p>Now don’t get me wrong, MailChimp is an excellent campaign manager at a professional level but it isn’t simple. There are too many clicks and steps to actually send out what you want to send out. It takes too long for an average joe like me to figure it out. </p>

          <p>It’s just not the case for Revue which is more like learning how to use <a href="http://medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>. You type in what you want and click send. Done.  </p>

          <p>I love that when you sign up with Revue you’re immediately presented with the new issue page. No mucking about. It gets you experimenting and playing with the editor straight away. It provides you with more writing time (and thus a better quality newsletter) because you don’t have to do or learn as many nerdy email technicalities.  </p>

          <p>A huge win for Revue over MailChimp is the archive page. The way past issues are displayed in this grid style looks lovely, and it can be used as a landing page because it also has a subscribe to newsletter form at the top.   </p>

          <p>I haven’t yet mentioned the design of the actual email templates either. You have an option of two templates and both are simple. You get a nice title and description area, and the default colour scheme pops. The way that links are displayed I think is what most people are really enjoying about Revue and you can also look at your Twitter feed to kind of cross post previous links you’ve shared there. </p>

          <p>The reason I cross post is because not many of my close friends have Twitter, so cross posting links that I’ve shared works great. It’s like a new alternative to random news article sharing, spreading what I’m reading, because I don’t want to do that on Facebook (apart from sharing my own work). </p>

          <p>Some other things I enjoy about Revue include: the subscribe forms within the emails themselves. Like the archive page, it’s done in a tasteful way that attracts people to subscribe. I’ve seen too many yucky “subscribe to our list” pop ups in my time and this simple style just crushes that in your face advertising. The statistics are super simple. You see exactly what each user has clicked on. Helpful. The MailChimp list import worked like a charm. If you want to switch from MailChimp the process couldn’t be any easier. The pricing is fair. I have barely any subscribers so it’s just $5 a month. It scales up to $135 a month based on how large your list is. </p>
          </ul>

          <p>If you’re a creator or marketer I highly suggest checking Revue out. You can also <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/harrisonmalone?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profileimage&utm_medium=email&utm_source=The+Melon" target="_blank">subscribe to my Revue newsletter here</a>. </p>
