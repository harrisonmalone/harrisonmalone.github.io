          <h2>Instagram Is Pissing Me Off</h2>
          <div class="dateline">11 January 2018</div>
          <p>Has anyone noticed that Instagram has become especially annoying in the last couple of months?</p>

          <p>It’s an app that I was addicted to. Addicted to watching stories and checking for updates in peoples lives who for the most part I don’t even see in person... at least not in years. And being jealous of the cool shit they were up to and seemingly how better off they were than me. Not a healthy life choice at all. </p>
          
          <p>To reiterate I was addicted to Instagram. </p>
          
          <p>This week I’ve reached a tipping point and kind of an epiphany based on shit design updates the Instagram team have made incrementally. </p>
          
          <p>Firstly, the feed is now a monstrosity which consists of ads, recommendations of people I might like to follow and unordered (non chronological) mess. </p>
          
          <p>When I see something from fucking 3 days ago at the top of my feed I get mad. Why do Twitter and Instagram do this to us! At least with Twitter you can use a third party app to get chronology back but Instagram has no public APIs to allow for alternatives. This I can deal with though. It’s not a deal breaker. </p>
          
          <p>The dealbreakers are the ads and the recommendation algorithm. I swear to god I’ve seen the 7/11 slurpee ad about a million times. And there are just too many distractions in total within the feed. I scroll down expecting to just see some photos and then boom (3 photos in) I get an ad followed by a “suggestions for you” prompt followed by another ad followed by recent stories. </p>
          
          <p>Secondly, there’s the discovery tab. I bet there are a lot of people out there who look at their discovery feed and think fuck I’m a weirdo. Looking through my discovery feed is a mixture of running photos, girls in bikinis and viral videos of people who shifted across from Vine when that shut down. </p>
          
          <p>It’s just too much clutter and shit that I don’t want to see. </p>
          
          <p>Facebook acquiring Instagram was probably one of the smartest tech acquisitions in history (maybe just behind Google acquiring YouTube). But  Facebook are imho one of the dumbest companies lately when it comes to design. And Instagram is suffering as a result. </p>
          
          <p>As I mentioned, I was addicted to Instagram yet I wasn’t really an active contributor or poster of content. Primarily, I viewed other peoples stories. I feel like when this is the case you are kind of wasting your time.  </p>
          
          <p>I think it was wrong of Instagram to straight up copy what Snapchat had created (stories was really their IP) but the way they implemented stories into the app made it more addictive. </p>
          
          <p>But think about what you’re doing with your time! What is the point of looking at what people are up to who you don’t even communicate with. Your focus and time should be on your close mates. The ones who actually care about you. </p>
          
          <p>I don’t really want to share my phone photos to the world anyway, especially when I’m still stuck with an old 6s camera. I just want these close mates to see what I’m doing. </p>
          
          <p>I’m also a person who gains a lot more value from words rather than images. That is why I love Twitter despite it’s many many flaws. It’s the best app for getting news and wasting time in a more productive manner.  </p>
          
          <p>So the decision I’ve come to is to essentially limit my Instagram usage and to only open the app when I get a notification. I use it as a chat app with some of my friends so obviously I’m not getting rid of that. </p>
          
          <p>I’ve gone back to Snapchat for sharing my phone photos simply because I can have a really small amount of people who follow me (my close mates) and share it within that group. It’s simple, it’s fast and I waste less time looking at fucking ads and recommendations. </p>
