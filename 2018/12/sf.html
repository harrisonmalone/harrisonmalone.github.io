        <p>Just a quick little post late on a hot Friday night in December. I'm kind of bored and was just reminiscing on some memories by looking at photos from last years trip to the west coast of the United States.</p>
        <p>I started off by hiring out a bike and riding it to the golden gate bridge. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8sj7wueu0m0mge0/golden_gate.jpg?dl=0">This</a> is on the city side and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/g5zxxrbpfdtwxp8/me_at_golden_gate.jpg?dl=0">this</a> is up the top of a gigantic hill that we were crazy to ride up.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/l3lpx7lbz3wulqp/painted_ladies.jpg?dl=0">painted ladies</a> are incredibly photographic buildings.</p>
        <p>This is kind of an <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jzqh61vx4f6x8zs/bay_red_bush.jpg?dl=0">underrated photo</a> in my collection. There's some nice colour in the bushes and I'm overlooking the bay from a nice spot. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8vh7eisuu8753q2/sf_city.jpg?dl=0">Twin peaks</a> was an incredible spot to take photos from. I went up there twice.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p7k7cpw6z1xf8go/alcatraz.jpg?dl=0">Alcatraz</a> is obviously a key thing to get a photo of. There's also <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tcbf8m9za2302ug/rolling_hills_alcatraz.jpg?dl=0">this photo</a> of it in the background overlooking the bay again.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/u6fjycmsua8553j/housing_blocks_pacific.jpg?dl=0">pacific ocean</a> made me feel closer to home than I had been for a year. The beach is very different there.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/co263gqnyaoumyw/setting_sun_rolling_hills.jpg?dl=0">sun set</a> on what was one of my favorite city experiences I'd ever had.</p>
