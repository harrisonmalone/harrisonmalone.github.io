        <h2>Kids</h2>
        <p>I often love looking at photos when me and Jake were kids. It's kind of relaxing and it makes me very nostalgic. I used the Google photo scanner to scan these photos and then uploaded them to dropbox.</p>

        <p>This is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p5rp2h76b2201zr/ruby_pup.jpg?dl=0">when Ruby was</a> a pup. I love looking at the old Stradbroke Avenue especially the colour of the couch and the VCRs in the background.</p>
