        <h2>Learning About Progressive Web Apps</h2>
        <div class='dateline'>12 July 2017</div>
        <p>Whilst I know my future career will likely have nothing to do with software development I’m still passionate about it and try to learn the new frameworks and technologies. One technology that I’ve been interested in for a while now is progressive web apps. I really wanted to get a little deeper knowledge into the design and code behind web apps as I love Google products like Inbox, Keep and Drive. These are web apps I use on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>When I had a bit of time at work I did some research on where I could find tutorials that better explained the fundamentals of web apps. I eventually came across Google’s Codelabs and this web app tutorial in particular. It sounded like exactly what I was looking for so I set aside some time over the next few evenings to work my way through it. As a side note, there are so many many amazing online resources to learn about how to build software. I think there is still a lot of room for disruption in online learning, especially in other creative industries like journalism, music or design. I’d love to see more of explaining how something is made or done and then actually shipping it on the same platform. I might write another article about this soon…</p>
        <p>Anyway back to doing the Codelab. Because my development background isn’t that strong I didn’t understand what was going on half the time. There were some pretty technical instruction being handed out (Javascript service workers) but I did understand the basic HTML and CSS architecture. I just followed the steps and did what it told me to do with copy pasting the code. Like most things Google, I thought the design of the tutorial was really nice and enjoyed the six hours that I spent on it a lot.
        What you end up with</p>
        <p>The final result is that you build this weather app. It looks very simplistic in design but the front end development is interesting to me. The tutorial takes you through the process of creating an app shell which means that your web app will load super fast and function offline as the UI elements of the page are cached. It separates the core application infrastructure and UI from the data, which in this case is the weather information. This chapter in the tutorial explains it all much better.</p>
        <p>On mobile, you can also install a progressive web app on your home screen with a few simple taps. Basically the tutorial teaches you how to build a native app but you access it in the browser. This excites me for a few reasons, but namely that I think useful web apps will crush the app store. A lot of tech writers have talked about how app stores are on their last legs (like this guy) but web apps could turn this around. I think the willingness to test new apps has been dwindling because the app store experience sucks. Even if the Apple app store redesign is amazing I still think that web app discovery and downloading is just far more simple and intuitive. I like the fact that because web apps run in the browser they are open to be used on any device at any time. And they don’t take up unnecessarily large amounts of space for apps that you’ll only use on the odd occasion.</p>
        <p>My passion for web apps is especially relevant to taking notes and storing files at work. I tried using Evernote but it failed. I then tried using Dropbox Paper (as we used Dropbox at my last office) but that also failed. I now use Google Keep and Docs which I think is a great workflow but I wish there was a better way to work with notes. I prefer using markdown when I’m typing so the dream for me would be a hybrid of iAWriter, Google Keep, Medium and Slack. You should be able to store files by dragging and dropping into a document that then automatically backs up in Google Drive. It would also be cool if you could set reminders in a document on your laptop/desktop that could send a notification to your phone when you tell it to. The delivery of this could be similar to the reminder system you get in Google Inbox which I like a lot. The UI elements of Medium are of course what I like I’d like to see in my hybrid app, plus the simplicity and playfulness of Google Keep.</p>
